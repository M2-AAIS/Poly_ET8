\section{The necessity of the Accretion-Jet Mechanism}

\subsection{Active Galactic Nuclei}

\subsubsection{Radio quiet, Seyfert galaxies}

The first spectrum of a Seyfert galaxy was taken in 1943.

In the catalogue of 3C sources, it was first observed that there was a large
population of highly blue "stars" with unknown large lines (8000 km/s), like in
3C48 (Matthews et al., 1961, AAS, Dec1960). Moreover it was noticed that those
objects where redshifted. Greenstein and Schmidt, in 1964, for 3C48 and 3C273,
measured redshifts of $z=0.45$ and $0.16$. Thus those objects have to be at
cosmological distances but with very high luminosity.

Seyfert galaxies are usually spiral galaxies. They have a radio core, which
fluctuates in brightness. Because of the intense radio core they are classified
in the larger family of Active Galactic Nuclei. A long debate occurred
initially to know if the radio emission could be constructed form star burst
emission. Nowadays, the radio core and the whole spectrum (because we have
multi-wavelength observations) is understood as the result of the emission of
an accretion disk with or without outflows around a central supermassive black
hole.

As radio-quiet objects represent $\sim 90 \% $ of the 'average' AGN, they also
represent a very large source for the gamma ray background emission at low
level.

Illustrations: NGC 4258, Seyfert galaxy in Ursa major. Supermassive black hole
of 39 million Sun mass. Warped disk, two light years in diameter.

H2O masers amplify the microwave radio emission disk edge-on orbits 2 million
miles per hour.

\subsubsection{Radio Loud, Narrow Line Radio Galaxies}

Conversely to Seyfert galaxies, radio loud galaxies have an extended radio
emission in addition to the radio core. They are usually seen in giant
elliptical galaxies and not spiral ones. From our observational point of view,
the most powerful sources as such are of course quasars and BL Lac objects.
However the most striking structure is seen in radio galaxies of Fanaroff Riley
types.

from the central black hole of the galaxy. This is a composite of images
obtained with three instruments, operating at very different wavelengths.[...]

Radio loud sources and quasars have relativistic jets in addition to the
accretion disk, with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-V^2/c^2}}$
of 3 to 10 or possibly higher.

They are two types of radio loud galaxies, FRI and FRII.
\begin{itemize}
    \item FRI radio galaxies show elongated jets on both sides, on the kpc
          scale terminated with two radio lobes (spatially extended structure).
          On the pc scale, we see one-sides jets with relativistic speeds. On
          the kpc, the jet is sub-relativistic and has decelerated.
    \item FRII radio galaxies are one sided and relativistic on the pc and the
          kpc scales. The are more powerful and terminated with two hot spots.
          This implies that, although the visible jet is one sided, counter jet
          exist but is invisible because it is not relativistically beamed.
    \item HYMORS is a new class of FR galaxies, which are FRI on one side and
          FRII on the other side. This may be explained if the environment
          plays an important role.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quasars, BL Lac, QSO}

The other radio sources belong to the wider class of quasars (quasi-stellar
objects). They are radio quiet as well as radio loud quasars (QSOs). As for
radio galaxies, proper motions could be measured in some quasars with jets. In
all cases high relativistic velocities are deduced. Quasars, BL Lac and QSO
appear to be pointing towards us, which explains - because of the Doppler
effect - that they are more luminous than radio galaxies.

\subsection{Young Stellar Objects}

\subsubsection{Definition}

A \textbf{pre-main sequence star} (PMS star or PMS object) is a star that has
not yet reached the main sequence. In the following we shall consider mainly
loss mass stars with mass less or equal to two solar masses. High mass pre-main
sequence star exhibits strong outflows and winds but not well structure jets at
least at the present stage of observations. Loss mass stars go through the
stage of T Tauri star or FU Orionis star ($<2$ solar mass). High mass stars are
usually Herbig Ae/Be stars (2-8 solar mass).

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{HH objects and $CO$ Outflows}{HH objects and CO Outflows}}

Jets in YSOs where first seen through HH objects. They were defined as bright
knots initially. Usually aligned along a given axis. With the development of
new instruments (in particular the HST), they appear as complex structure and
often internal shocks or bow shocks. Bow shocks are characterized by the
C-Shock front as seen on the extremity of HH34 below (right).

In HH34 (and many other HH objects), the evolution seen from various successive
observations allows to measure proper motion of the knots. Typical values of a
few hundreds of km/s are usually inferred. However some knots may be standing
shocks and the proper motion of the shocks is not directly the speed of the
underlying jets though similar velocities are measured by other means.

These premain stars have accretion-ejection systems with typical accretion
rates of $\dot{M}_{accr}=10^{-7}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ to $10^{-6}M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$.
Around $30\%$ of these objects also have jets with typical wind mass loss rates
of $\dot{M}_{jet}=10^{-8}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ to $10^{-7}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, densities
$n_{jet}=10^3$ to $10^7\un{cm^{-3}}$ (this is strongly model dependent) and
temperatures around $10^3$ to $10^4 \un{K}$. Of course the density in the accretion
disk is much higher and the temperature much lower.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Molecular flows $H_2$, $CO$}{Molecular flows H2, CO}}

Next picture of the HST is called ``Birth and death of the Milky Way''. It shows
a multi-wavelength picture with dark clouds illuminated and ionized by stars.
Clouds are clumps resulting from the Parker instability in the Milky Way. They
are themselves unstable and because of gravitational collapse they contract
forming accretion torii and disks.

Some disks (seen in infra red, red contours in next figure) show very powerful
molecular outflows sometimes associated with the previous HH objects and
Optical jets but not always. Molecular outflows with mass loss rates of
$\dot{M}_{jet}=10^{-5}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, velocity a few 10 km/s and cold
temperatures of a tens of Kelvin. The underlying accretion disks have accretion
rates higher than typically $\dot{M}_{acrr}=10^{-4}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$.

HH211: Another nice example of a powerful molecular outflow with its inner
accretion disk. Note that the inner structure is not very different from some
pictures of Planetary Nebulae.

Molecular outflows are collimated in the observational perspective but not as
well as optical jets. From a theoretical point of view the opening angle is so
large that they may be considered as uncollimated winds. The opening angle is
the angle the outflow makes from its central source. They are usually
surrounding the optical jet when there is one.

\subsubsection{Accretion in YSOs}

The accretion process is always present even if outflows are not. This means
either that the ejection is episodic or (more likely) that accretion does not
necessarily require all the time the formation of a collimated source.

Before having disk images, the presence of an accretion disk was deduced from
the infrared excess measured by the Spectral Index. \[\text{Spectral
Index:}\quad \alpha=\frac{d\log(\nu F)}{d \log(\nu)}\quad\text{where}\quad
F_{\nu}\quad\text{is the flux density.}\] For disks in YSO, the spectral index
is calculated in the wavelength interval of $2.2-10 \un{\mu m}$ (near infrared
region).

In 1986 Lada C.J. and Wilking B.A. were the first to established the existence
of various classes now known as Class I,II,III. In 1993 Andre et al. discovered
a younger class called class 0, with a strong sub-millimeter emission, but very
faint at $\lambda<10\un{\mu m}$. In summary the classes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class 0} sources: undetectable at $\lambda<10\un{\mu m}$
    \item \textbf{Class I} sources: $\alpha>0.3$
    \item \textbf{Flat spectrum} sources: $0.3>\alpha>-0.3$
    \item \textbf{Class II} sources: $-0.3>\alpha>-1.6$
    \item \textbf{Class III} sources: $\alpha<-1.6$
\end{itemize}

The following figure gives a schematic view of the spectrum and the role of the
accretion disk (from AndrÃ©, 1996).

More information on accretion disks is expected from next generation of
instruments like ALMA and Herschell (HIFI).

\subsection{Need for Accretion, Eddington Luminosity}

\subsubsection{Luminosity: Only gravity can do it}

Why do we need to have accretion ? After all the equilibrium of disk does not
need any accretion, it could rapidly be under the action of the centrifugal
force.

Accretion,
\begin{itemize}
    \item allows to increase the mass of the central object, either black hole
          or super massive black hole in AGN, or Young Stars. This is of course
          an essential ingredient in the process of star formation and Active
          Galactic Nuclei formation.
    \item is a way to convert gravitational energy into radiation. This was the
          first argument to invoke accretion in the context of cataclysmic
          variables.
    \item is a way to redistribute angular momentum:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item either because of viscosity. This is thought to be the case
                    in low magnetization disk where there is no outflow. The
                    low magnetization also favors MRI magneto rotational
                    instabilities and thus the presence of highly turbulent
                    accretion
              \item or because it induces a strong outflow. This would be the
                    case for highly magnetized disk where the
                    magnetocentrifugal driving can eject plasma. Magnetic
                    diffusivity is still needed however.
          \end{itemize}
    \item is a way to brake the central star. The braking of the central star
          was though to occur through the magnetosphere connection between the
          star and the disk. This is the so-called disk locking. In the case of
          YSO, it turns out to be inefficient and stellar winds are needed.
\end{itemize}

In order to quantify accretion we can estimate the specific available energy.
It corresponds to the free fall energy:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{E}{m} \approx \frac{GM_*}{R}
\end{equation}

The available power is:

\begin{align}
P & = \frac{dE}{dt} \approx \frac{GM_*}{R} \frac{dm}{dt} = \frac{GM_*}{R} \dot{M}_{acc}
    \\
  &\approx 10^{38} \left(\frac{\dot{M}_{acc}}{10^{18} \un{g/s}}\right) \left(\frac{M}{2\E{33}\un{g}}\right) \left(\frac{7\E{10}\un{cm}}{R}\right) \un{erg/s}
    \\
  &\approx 10^{38} \left(\frac{\dot{M}_{acc}}{10^{-8} \un{M/yr}}\right) \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{R_{\odot}}{R}\right) \un{erg/s}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
  M_{\odot} &= 2 \E{33}\un{g} \\
  R_{\odot} &= 7 \E{10}\un{cm} \\
  R_{NS}   &= 10 \un{km} = 10^{6} \un{cm} = 10^{-4} R_{\odot}
\end{align}

Thus the available power depends on the accretion rate and the compactness M/R. The efficiency is the conversion rate,
\begin{equation}
 \frac{dE}{dt} = \varepsilon \dot{M} c^{2} \Rightarrow \varepsilon = \frac{GM_*}{c^{2}R} 
\end{equation}
\\
\\
In the Newtonian regime, we obtain an efficiency of $\varepsilon = 0.15$ for an object with a radius of 10 km, 1 $M_{\odot}$, typical for a neutron star or a non rotating galactic black hole.
\\
\\
In the relativistic regime for a black hole in maximum rotation we have a larger range of efficiency $\varepsilon \approx 0.059-0.42$
\\
\\
We can compare the efficiency in various fields in Physics :
\begin{itemize}
  \item In Chemistry the typical energy is $\approx 13\un{eV}$, energy of ionization, therefore $\varepsilon < 10^{-8}$ thus
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{dE}{dt} \approx \frac{1 eV}{m_{p}c^{2}} m_{p}c^{2}\dot{M}
  \end{equation}
  \item In nuclear fusion $\approx$ 1 MeV, $4H \rightarrow He$ , $\varepsilon < 10^{-2}$
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {\Delta E_{4H \rightarrow He}}{mc^{2}} \approx \dfrac{4m_{H}-m_{He}}{4m_{H}c^{2}} c^{2}\dot{M}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Accretion is ten times more efficient per mass unit to convert energy with a compact object.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If it is a galactic Black Hole we get
  \begin{equation}
  R_{S} =\frac{2GM_{BH}}{c^{2}} = 3 \un{km} \frac{M_{BH}}{R_{S}} = 10^{5}\frac{M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}} , \varepsilon = 0.5
  \end{equation}
  \item This is similar for a Neutron Star
  \item For a Supermassive Black Hole the compactness and the efficiency are identical, only the radius differs
  \begin{equation}
  R_{S} =\frac{2GM_{BH}}{c^{2}} = 3\E{11}-10^{14} \un{cm}
  \end{equation}
  \item For a White Dwarf
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {M_{WD}}{R_{*}} =10^{2}\frac{M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}} , M_{WD} = M_{\odot}, R_{*}=10^{-2}R_{\odot} = 10^{9} \un{cm}
  \end{equation}
  \item For a Young Star
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {M_{YSO}}{R_{*}} \approx \frac{M_{*}}{R_{*}} , M_{YSO} = M_{\odot}, R_{*}=2R_{\odot} = 2\E{11} \un{cm}
  \end{equation}
  \item For Jupiter
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {M_{J}}{R_{*}} = 10^{-2}\frac{M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}} , M_{J} = 10^{-3}M_{\odot}, R_{*}=0.1R_{\odot} = 10^{10}\un{cm}
  \end{equation}
