\section*{Preamble}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preamble}

Jets are seen at all scales from young born stars (Young Stellar Objects,
YSOs), in binaries and galactic blak holes up to extragalactic sources (Active
Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) and at all energies including highly relativistic Gamma
Ray Bursts (GRBs). Those jets seem to be systematically associated with
accretion disk with the possible exception of GRBs. Conversely those objects
also have accretion disks but the majority is not assciated with jets or at
least visible jets.

With the improvements of observations though, especially the HST, there are
growing evidences that most disks have outflows or winds even if they do not
collimate into jets. Thus this lecture will start with a general overview of
those systems with disks and outflows from the observational point of view
(Chapter~I). In Chapter~II we introduce the various mechanisms and models that
explain accretion, outflows, acceleration and collimation, in other words the
dynamics of the plasma. Chapter~III goes back from extraglactic to galactic
scales to give some hints on the specificities of each systems especially in
terms of radiation and spectra.

Various units are used depending on the system. In particular masses are
usually given in solar mass unit. Discances are given either in solar radius,
astronomical units or parsecs. The following correspondence is useful.

\begin{align*}
    \si{\Msun} &= \SI{2e33}{\gram} \\
    \si{\Rsun} &= \SI{7e10}{\cm} \\
    \SI{1}{\au} &= 215 R_\odot = \SI{1.5e13}{\cm} \\
    \SI{1}{\pc} &= \SI{2.06e5}{\au} = \SI{3e18}{\cm} = \SI{3.26}{\ly}
\end{align*}

\section{The necessity of the Accretion-Jet Mechanism}

\subsection{Active Galactic Nuclei}

\subsubsection{Radio quiet, Seyfert galaxies}

The first spectrum of a Seyfert galaxy was taken in 1943.

\FIXME{Missing figure}

In the catalogue of 3C sources, it was first observed that there was a large
population of highly blue “stars” with unknown large lines
(\SI{8000}{\km\per\s}), like in 3C48 (Matthews et al., 1961, AAS, Dec1960).
Moreover it was noticed that those objects where redshifted. Greenstein and
Schmidt, in 1964, for 3C48 and 3C273, measured redshifts of $z=0.45$ and
$0.16$. Thus those objects have to be at cosmological distances but with very
high luminosity.

\FIXME{Make Matthews et al. a reference + missing figure x2}

Seyfert galaxies are usually spiral galaxies. They have a radio core, which
fluctuates in brightness. Because of the intense radio core they are classified
in the larger family of Active Galactic Nuclei. A long debate occurred
initially to know if the radio emission could be constructed form star burst
emission. Nowadays, the radio core and the whole spectrum (because we have
multi-wavelength observations) is understood as the result of the emission of
an accretion disk with or without outflows around a central supermassive black
hole.

As radio-quiet objects represent $\sim \SI{90}{\percent}$ of the “average” AGN,
they also represent a very large source for the gamma ray background emission
at low level.

        %\caption{}
        %\label{fig:}

        NGC 4258 is a Seyfert galaxy in the constellation Ursa major. It is
        generally agreed to have at its heart a supermassive black hole some
        39 million times more massive than the Sun. Gas orbiting this black
        hole has formed a warped disk nearly two light years in diameter. By
        measuring extremely small shifts in the positions of \ce{H2O} masers
        (water vapor that amplifies microwave radio emissions) located in this
        disk, scientists have been able to measure the distance to this galaxy
        as 23.5 million light years, a measurement the scientists say is
        accurate to within a million light years.

        The disk is viewed nearly edge-on from Earth and orbits the black hole
        at a speed of more than 2 million miles per hour. Using the Very Long
        Baseline Array, the astronomers observed the Doppler shift of the
        masers at the disk's sides at 4 to 8 month intervals over more than
        three years. This shift, or “proper motion”, combined with previous
        observations in which astronomers had measured the speed of the
        orbiting disk and ascertained the mass of the black hole, has enabled
        the scientists to make the distance determination.

        Previous observations using Cepheid variable stars and the Hubble
        Space Telescope had set the distance at 27 or 29 million light years.
        The difference in these two distance determinations will make a
        significant impact on future calculations of the size and age of the
        Universe.

\subsubsection{Radio Loud, Narrow Line Radio Galaxies}

Conversely to Seyfert galaxies, radio loud galaxies have an extended radio
emission in addition to the radio core. They are usually seen in giant
elliptical galaxies and not spiral ones. From our observational point of view,
the most powerful sources as such are of course quasars and BL Lac objects.
However the most striking structure is seen in radio galaxies of Fanaroff Riley
types.

        different wavelengths. The 870-micron submillimetre data, from LABOCA
        on APEX, are shown in orange. X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray
        Observatory are shown in blue. Visible light data from the Wide Field
        Imager (WFI) on the MPG/ESO \SI{2.2}{\m} telescope located at La Silla, Chile,
        show the stars and the galaxy’s characteristic dust lane in close to
        “true colour”.

Radio loud sources and quasars have relativistic jets in addition to the
accretion disk, with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-V^2/c^2}}$
of 3 to 10 or possibly higher.

        %\label{fig:}
        This image shows the radio morphology of the radio galaxy 3C31 (NGC
        383), the dominant galaxy of a prominent chain of galaxies. This system
        is a powerful radio source, with conical inner jets developing into
        distorted plumes, which stretch to a distance of 300 kpc from the
        center of the galaxy (980,000 light years, for a Hubble constant of 100
        km/s/Mpc). The radio emission is due to relativistic streams of high
        energy particles generated by the radio source at the center of the
        radio galaxy. Astronomers believe that the jets are fueled by material
        accreting onto a super-massive black hole. The high energy particles
        are shot into extragalactic space at speeds approaching the speed of
        light, where they eventually balloon into massive radio plumes.

They are two types of radio loud galaxies, FRI and FRII.
\begin{itemize}
    \item FRI radio galaxies show elongated jets on both sides, on the kpc
          scale terminated with two radio lobes (spatially extended structure).
          On the pc scale, we see one-sides jets with relativistic speeds. On
          the kpc, the jet is sub-relativistic and has decelerated.
    \item FRII radio galaxies are one sided and relativistic on the pc and the
          kpc scales. The are more powerful and terminated with two hot spots.
          This implies that, although the visible jet is one sided, counter jet
          exist but is invisible because it is not relativistically beamed.
    \item HYMORS is a new class of FR galaxies, which are FRI on one side and
          FRII on the other side. This may be explained if the environment
          plays an important role.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quasars, BL Lac, QSO}

The other radio sources belong to the wider class of quasars (quasi-stellar
objects). They are radio quiet as well as radio loud quasars (QSOs). As for
radio galaxies, proper motions could be measured in some quasars with jets. In
all cases high relativistic velocities are deduced. Quasars, BL Lac and QSO
appear to be pointing towards us, which explains - because of the Doppler
effect - that they are more luminous than radio galaxies.

\subsection{Young Stellar Objects}

\subsubsection{Definition}

A \textbf{pre-main sequence star} (PMS star or PMS object) is a star that has
not yet reached the main sequence. In the following we shall consider mainly
loss mass stars with mass less or equal to two solar masses. High mass pre-main
sequence star exhibits strong outflows and winds but not well structure jets at
least at the present stage of observations. Loss mass stars go through the
stage of T-Tauri star or FU Orionis star ($<\SI{2}{M_\odot}$). High mass stars are
usually Herbig Ae/Be stars (\SIrange{2}{8}{M_\odot}).

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{HH objects and $CO$ Outflows}{HH objects and CO Outflows}}

Jets in YSOs where first seen through HH objects. They were defined as bright
knots initially. Usually aligned along a given axis. With the development of
new instruments (in particular the HST), they appear as complex structure and
often internal shocks or bow shocks. Bow shocks are characterized by the
C-Shock front as seen on the extremity of HH34 below (right).

In HH34 (and many other HH objects), the evolution seen from various successive
observations allows to measure proper motion of the knots. Typical values of a
few hundreds of km/s are usually inferred. However some knots may be standing
shocks and the proper motion of the shocks is not directly the speed of the
underlying jets though similar velocities are measured by other means.

These premain stars have accretion-ejection systems with typical accretion
rates of $\dot{M}_{accr}=\SI{e7}{M_\odot.yr^{-1}}$ to $\SI{e-6}{M_{\odot}.yr^{-1}}$.
Around $30\%$ of these objects also have jets with typical wind mass loss rates
of $\dot{M}_{jet}=\SI{e-8}{M_{\odot}.yr^{-1}}$ to $\SI{e-7}{M_{\odot}.yr^{-1}}$, densities
$n_{jet}=10^3$ to $\SI{e7}{cm^{-3}}$ (this is strongly model dependent) and
temperatures around $10^3$ to $\SI{e4}{K}$. Of course the density in the accretion
disk is much higher and the temperature much lower.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Molecular flows $H_2$, $CO$}{Molecular flows H2, CO}}

Next picture of the HST is called ``Birth and death of the Milky Way''. It shows
a multi-wavelength picture with dark clouds illuminated and ionized by stars.
Clouds are clumps resulting from the Parker instability in the Milky Way. They
are themselves unstable and because of gravitational collapse they contract
forming accretion torii and disks.

Some disks (seen in infra red, red contours in next figure) show very powerful
molecular outflows sometimes associated with the previous HH objects and
Optical jets but not always. Molecular outflows with mass loss rates of
$\dot{M}_{jet}=\SI{e-5}{M_{\odot}.yr^{-1}}$, velocity a few 10 km/s and cold
temperatures of a tens of Kelvin. The underlying accretion disks have accretion
rates higher than typically $\dot{M}_{accr}=\SI{e-4}{M_{\odot}.yr^{-1}}$.

HH211: Another nice example of a powerful molecular outflow with its inner
accretion disk. Note that the inner structure is not very different from some
pictures of Planetary Nebulae.

Molecular outflows are collimated in the observational perspective but not as
well as optical jets. From a theoretical point of view the opening angle is so
large that they may be considered as uncollimated winds. The opening angle is
the angle the outflow makes from its central source. They are usually
surrounding the optical jet when there is one.

\subsubsection{Accretion in YSOs}

The accretion process is always present even if outflows are not. This means
either that the ejection is episodic or (more likely) that accretion does not
necessarily require all the time the formation of a collimated source.

Before having disk images, the presence of an accretion disk was deduced from
the infrared excess measured by the Spectral Index. \[\text{Spectral
Index:}\quad \alpha=\frac{\d\log(\nu F)}{\d \log(\nu)}\quad\text{where}\quad
F_{\nu}\quad\text{is the flux density.}\] For disks in YSO, the spectral index
is calculated in the wavelength interval of $2.2-\SI{10}{\um}$ (near infrared
region).

In 1986 Lada C.J. and Wilking B.A. were the first to established the existence
of various classes now known as Class I,II,III. In 1993 Andre et al. discovered
a younger class called class 0, with a strong sub-millimeter emission, but very
faint at $\lambda<\SI{10}{\um}$. In summary the classes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class 0} sources: undetectable at $\lambda<\SI{10}{\um}$
    \item \textbf{Class I} sources: $\alpha>0.3$
    \item \textbf{Flat spectrum} sources: $0.3>\alpha>-0.3$
    \item \textbf{Class II} sources: $-0.3>\alpha>-1.6$
    \item \textbf{Class III} sources: $\alpha<-1.6$
\end{itemize}

The following figure gives a schematic view of the spectrum and the role of the
accretion disk (from André, 1996).

More information on accretion disks is expected from next generation of
instruments like ALMA and Herschell (HIFI).

\subsection{Need for Accretion, Eddington Luminosity}

\subsubsection{Luminosity: Only gravity can do it}

Why do we need to have accretion ? After all the equilibrium of disk does not
need any accretion, it could rapidly be under the action of the centrifugal
force.

Accretion,
\begin{itemize}
    \item allows to increase the mass of the central object, either black hole
          or super massive black hole in AGN, or Young Stars. This is of course
          an essential ingredient in the process of star formation and Active
          Galactic Nuclei formation.
    \item is a way to convert gravitational energy into radiation. This was the
          first argument to invoke accretion in the context of cataclysmic
          variables.
    \item is a way to redistribute angular momentum:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item either because of viscosity. This is thought to be the case
                    in low magnetization disk where there is no outflow. The
                    low magnetization also favors MRI magneto rotational
                    instabilities and thus the presence of highly turbulent
                    accretion
              \item or because it induces a strong outflow. This would be the
                    case for highly magnetized disk where the
                    magnetocentrifugal driving can eject plasma. Magnetic
                    diffusivity is still needed however.
          \end{itemize}
    \item is a way to brake the central star. The braking of the central star
          was though to occur through the magnetosphere connection between the
          star and the disk. This is the so-called disk locking. In the case of
          YSO, it turns out to be inefficient and stellar winds are needed.
\end{itemize}

In order to quantify accretion we can estimate the specific available energy.
It corresponds to the free fall energy:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{E}{m} \approx \frac{GM_*}{R}
\end{equation}

The available power is:

\begin{align}
P & = \frac{dE}{dt} \approx \frac{GM_*}{R} \frac{\d m}{\d t} = \frac{GM_*}{R} \dot{M}_{acc}
    \\
  &\approx \num{e38} \left(\frac{\dot{M}_{acc}}{\SI{e18}{\g\per\s}}\right) \left(\frac{M}{\SI{2e33}{\g}}\right) \left(\frac{\SI{7e10}{\cm}}{R}\right) \si{\erg\per\s}
    \\
  &\approx 10^{38} \left(\frac{\dot{M}_{acc}}{\SI{e-8}{M\per\yr}}\right) \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{R_{\odot}}{R}\right) \si{\erg\per\s}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
  M_{\odot} &= \SI{2e33}{g} \\
  R_{\odot} &= \SI{7e10}{\cm} \\
  R_{NS}   &= \SI{10}{\km} = \SI{e6}{\cm} = \SI{e-4}{R_\odot}
\end{align}

Thus the available power depends on the accretion rate and the compactness M/R. The efficiency is the conversion rate,
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\d E}{\d t} = \varepsilon \dot{M} c^{2} \Rightarrow \varepsilon = \frac{GM_*}{c^{2}R}
\end{equation}

In the Newtonian regime, we obtain an efficiency of $\varepsilon = 0.15$ for an object with a radius of 10 km, 1 $M_{\odot}$, typical for a neutron star or a non rotating galactic black hole.

In the relativistic regime for a black hole in maximum rotation we have a larger range of efficiency $\varepsilon \approx 0.059-0.42$

We can compare the efficiency in various fields in Physics :
\begin{itemize}
  \item In Chemistry the typical energy is $\approx \SI{13}{eV}$, energy of ionization, therefore $\varepsilon < 10^{-8}$ thus
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{\d E}{\d t} \approx \frac{\SI{1}{eV}}{m_{p}c^{2}} m_{p}c^{2}\dot{M}
  \end{equation}
  \item In nuclear fusion $\approx \SI{1}{MeV}$, $4H \rightarrow He$ , $\varepsilon < 10^{-2}$
  \begin{equation}
    \frac {\Delta E_{4 \mathrm{H} \rightarrow \mathrm{He}}}{mc^{2}} \approx \dfrac{4m_\mathrm{H}-m_\mathrm{He}}{4m_\mathrm{H}c^{2}} c^{2}\dot{M}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Accretion is ten times more efficient per mass unit to convert energy with a compact object.
\begin{itemize}
  \item If it is a galactic Black Hole we get
  \begin{equation}
  R_{S} =\frac{2GM_{BH}}{c^{2}} = \SI{3}{\km} \frac{M_{BH}}{R_{S}} = 10^5\frac{M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}} , \varepsilon = 0.5
  \end{equation}
  \item This is similar for a Neutron Star
  \item For a Supermassive Black Hole the compactness and the efficiency are identical, only the radius differs
  \begin{equation}
  R_{S} =\frac{2GM_{BH}}{c^{2}} = \num{3e11}-\SI{e14}{cm}
  \end{equation}
  \item For a White Dwarf
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {M_{WD}}{R_{*}} =10^{2}\frac{M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}} ,\quad M_{WD} = M_{\odot},\quad R_{*}=10^{-2}R_{\odot} = \SI{e9}{cm}
  \end{equation}
  \item For a Young Star
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {M_{YSO}}{R_{*}} \approx \frac{M_{*}}{R_{*}} ,\quad M_{YSO} = M_{\odot},\quad R_{*}=2R_{\odot} = \SI{2e11}{cm}
  \end{equation}
  \item For Jupiter
  \begin{equation}
  \frac {M_{J}}{R_{*}} = 10^{-2}\frac{M_{\odot}}{R_{\odot}} ,\quad M_{J} = \SI{e-3}{M_{\odot}},\quad R_{*}=\SI{0.1}{R_{\odot}} = \SI{e10}{cm}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Eddington Luminosity}
We can define the Eddington luminosity, assuming isotropy and equilibrium between radiative pressure and gravity:
\begin{align}
  F_{grav} & = F_{rad} \\
  \frac{GMm_p}{R^2} &= P_{rad}\sigma_{T,\gamma/e^{-}} \\
           & = \frac{u_{rad}}{3}\sigma_T \\
           &= \frac{1}{3}\frac{LR}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 c}\\
  \frac{GMm_p}{R^2} &= \frac{L\sigma_T}{4\pi R^2 c}
\end{align}
\fxnote{Missing picture}

We can rewrite the gravitational force:
\begin{equation}
  F_\mathrm{grav} = \frac{GMm_p}{R^2} = F_\mathrm{rad} = \sigma_T \frac{L}{4\pi R^2}\frac{1}{c}
\end{equation}

Thus, it defines a luminosity called \emph{Eddington Luminosity} where the radiative pressure gradient equals the gravitational force:
\begin{align}
  L_\mathrm{Edd} &\approx \num{e33} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right) \si{\erg\per\s} \\
  \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} &\approx \num{e18} \left( \frac{\varepsilon}{0.1} \right) \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right) \si{\g\per\s} = \SI{e-8}{M\per\yr}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{The disk spectrum}
Gas heating implies a balance between matter and radiation. This can be expressed under the form of a black body such that:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\d E}{\d t} = \frac{GM_\star}{R}\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} = 4\pi R^2\sigma T^4
\end{equation}
and the effective temperature of the equivalent black body is given by:
\begin{align}
  k_b T_{bb} & \approx \SI{2}{keV} \left( \frac{\dot{M}}{\SI{e-8}{M\per\yr}} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{R}{\SI{e-4} R_\odot} \right)^{-3/4} \\
  k_b T_{bb} & \approx \SI{1.5}{keV} \left( \frac{L_\mathrm{Edd}}{\SI{e38}{\erg\per\s}} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{R}{\SI{e6}{\cm}} \right)^{-1/2}
\end{align}
Then if all the radiation is converted into energy:
\begin{align}
  \frac{3}{2}\dot{M}\frac{k_b T_{bb}}{\mu m_H} & \approx \frac{GM_\star}{R}\dot{M_\mathrm{acc}}
\end{align}
\begin{equation} \tcboxmath{
  \begin{split}
    \frac{3}{2}k_bT_{bb} & \approx \mu m_H \frac{GM_\star}{R} \\
                         & \approx\num{90} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right) \left( \frac{R}{\SI{e6}{cm}} \right)^{-1} \si{MeV}
  \end{split}
}
\end{equation}

\fxnote{it is highlighted in the original text}

We get for:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{a galactic black hole}
  \begin{equation}
    \SI{2}{keV}\left( \frac{\dot{M}}{\SI{e-8}{M_\odot\per\year}} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{R}{\SI{e-4}{R_\odot}} \right)^{-3/4} < kT < \SI{90}{MeV}\left( \frac{M}{M_\odot} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{R}{\SI{e-4}{R_\odot}} \right)^{-1}
  \end{equation}
  For a mass loss rate of $\dot{M} = \SI{e-8}{M_\odot\per\year}$, the spectrum spans from soft X to gamma rays.
\item \textbf{a white dwarf}
  \begin{equation}
    \SI{10}{eV} < kT < \SI{45}{keV}
  \end{equation}
  The spectrum is from $\SI{1000}{\angstrom}$ to hard X rays.
\item \textbf{a $\SI{e8}{M_\odot}$ super-massive black hole} and an accretion rate $\dot{M} = 0.1-\SI{1}{M_\odot\per\yr}$,
  \begin{equation}
    \SI{20}{eV} < kT < \SI{90}{MeV}
  \end{equation}
  The spectrum is from UV to gamma, softer than stellar BHs
\item \textbf{a young low mass star} $M = M_\odot$, a mass loss rate of $\SIrange{e-7}{e-6}{M_\odot\per\year}$, the radiation spans :
  \begin{equation}
    0.3-\SI{3}{eV} < kT < \SI{4.5}{keV}
  \end{equation}
  corresponding to radiations from IR, visible to X rays.
\item \textbf{a Jupiter}, the range is
  \begin{equation}
    \SI{e-3}{eV} < kT < \SI{5}{eV}
  \end{equation}
  from far IR to optical

\end{itemize}

As a matter of fact the range of spectrum we just deduced coincides with the observed spectrum for accretion disks around these objects.


\subsubsection{AGN Luminosity and Spectra}
The luminosity observed in AGNs is of the order of $\SI{e46}{\erg\per\s}$. If the total luminosity is lower than the Eddington luminosity, which is reasonable, the mass of the central black hole has to be larger than $M > \SI{e8}{M_\odot}$.

The luminosity could be due to nuclear reactions, if we have a large population of star burst. This implies a burst rate of $\dot{M} \sim \SI{10}{M_\odot\per\yr}$. Considering that the galaxy has $M_\mathrm{galaxy} \sim \SI{e11}{M_\odot} \sim \SI{e11}{stars}$, it would be emptied in 10 billion years. This is too short and excludes the scenario of AGN being star burst galaxies.

Conversely, if the luminosity is due to accretion, the accretion rate required is $\dot{M} \sim \si{M_\odot\per\yr}$. The mass luminosity ratio is $M/L \sim 10$. Thus the luminosity of a standard galaxy is $L_\mathrm{galaxy} \sim \SI{e43}{\erg\per\s}$ and the luminosity of a quasar is a thousand times higher : $L_\mathrm{quasar}\sim 1000 L_\mathrm{galaxy}$. \textbf{For Seyfert galaxies, the luminosity is typically around $\SIrange{e43}{e45}{\erg\per\s}$ while for quasars it is between $\SIrange{e45}{e48}{\erg\per\s}$}.

The observed variability is typically of one week $\Delta t \sim \SI{6e5}{s}$. Considering that the speed of light is the upper speed limit, the causality principle implies that the emission region cannot be larger than $R \leq c\Delta t \sim \SI{2e16}{cm} \sim \SI{0.01}{pc}$. This means that the emission comes from a very narrow region with a rather high density. To satisfy this, it is difficult to have stellar clusters (e.g. Sgr A : $\SI{4e16}{M_\odot\per\pc^3}$).

The figure bellow \fxnote{put the figure} displays a typical \textbf{BL Lac Spectral Distribution}. \textbf{BL Lac} are typical radio loud AGNs. Nowadays, we have a good knowledge of the multi-wavelength spectrum from radio to gamma rays.

\textbf{Seyfert and Quasar Spectral Distributions} are quite similar to BL Lac. Each component is explained by the composition of the disk and the jet. The central BH is surrounded by a cold accretion disk of gas and dust. On top of the disk, close to the central object, a hot corona must be present. The radio levels depend on the presence or of a central jet.
\fxnote{Missing figure here}

The cascade model explains how the different frequencies are emitted and how they are correlated in space and time as shown in the following figure.
\fxnote{missing figure here}
\subsection{Need for Jets}
\subsubsection{Energy in the extended lobes}
In radio loud galaxies and quasars, an extended emission into the lobes is observed. Such galaxies are at cosmological distances, typically $\SI{200}{\Mpc}$. As $d\sim z\frac{c }{H}$, we have a redshift of $z\sim 0.05$.

Considering that the lobe size is of the order of magnitude $d_\mathrm{lobe}\sim \SI{100}{\kpc}$, for a plasma that moves in the at speed $v\sim \SI{e8}{\cm\per\s} = \SI{1000}{\km\per\s}$, the time delay necessary to reach the lobe is $\Delta t_\mathrm{life} \sim \frac{\num{e5}\times\num{3e18}}{\num{e8}} \si{Myr} \sim \SI{100}{Myr}$. The observed luminosity begin $\SI{e44}{\erg\per\s}$ at $\SI{e9}{\Hz}$, the amount of total energy is huge and equal to $\num{e44}\times\SI{3e15}{\erg} \sim \SI{e60}{\erg}$. This is equivalent to $\SI{e6}{M_\odot}$.

We observe radio emission both in extended and compact sources. In extended sources, the radio spectrum goes like $F_v \sim v^{-0.5} \textrm{ or } v^{-1}$, while in compact sources it is $F_v \sim \mathrm{cst}$. The nature of the emission is not obvious and was in question for sometimes \fxnote{not really English there}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thermal emission was immediately excluded for the radio component as it would have implied too high temperatures
\item \emph{Bremstrahlung} emission could have been a reasonable candidate, but because of absorption, one expects this process to be limited.
\item The observed high polarization could be the signature of a Compton emission but this would imply an extremely low temperature $T < \SI{3}{K}$.
\end{itemize}

Finally it turned out that \textbf{synchrotron} emission was the best candidate to explain the radio excess and the slope of the spectral emission.
\subsubsection{Synchrotron emission}
The total energy density in the lobes is
\begin{equation}
  U \sim \frac{10^{60}}{10^{69}} \approx \SI{e-9}{\erg\per\s}
\end{equation}
If we make a hypothesis of equipartition, which is completely arbitrary in the case of jets but the simplest assumption one can make, then $\frac{B^2}{8\pi} \sim \SI{e-9}{\erg\per\cm\cubed}$ and therefore $B \sim \SI{100}{\micro G}$. The synchrotron frequency is given by $\nu = \num{4.3e6} B\gamma^2 \sin\alpha\ \si{\Hz}$. At \SI{46}{Hz}, we have a Lorentz factors of $\gamma \sim \numrange{e3}{e4}$. This means that the synchrotron emission comes from relativistic electrons. The cooling time is of the order of \SI{1}{Myr}, which is much less than the life time. It has several consequences on the emission region:
\begin{itemize}
\item there must be an \emph{in situ} continuous production of highly relativistic electrons
\item only a jet can inject matter so far from the central core
\item there are shocks where electrons are re-accelerated
\end{itemize}

A large fraction of the total energy is not visible and must be in the form of kinetic energy. Only a jet that feeds the lobe can provide this energy, even if it is not visible.
\subsubsection{Proper motion}
Proper motion of knots is now measured in all the objects. These are the motion of the shocks so probably an underestimation of the jet speed itself. Nevertheless, the velocity is much higher than the local sonic speed and only jets can explain supersonic speeds. Typical values in YSO jets are a few hundreds of \si{\km\per\s}.

\fxnote{Missing figure of proper motion}

In AGN jets, we see apparent superluminal motions that can be explained only if the shocks and the jets are moving at (nearly) the speed of light. Superluminal motions are also observed in microquasars.
\fxnote{VLBA image + GRS 1915}
\subsection{Rotation and the Angular Momentum transfer}
\subsubsection{The Angular Momentum problems in YSO}
The biggest obstacle to the formation of stars from diffuse gas is that a star can contain only a tiny fraction (less than \SI{e18}{\cm\per\s}) of the initial angular momentum of the gas from which it formed (\SI{e23}{\cm\square\per\s} for a molecular cloud of scale \SI{1}{pc}, \SI{e23}{\cm\squared\per\s}), so that nearly all of this angular momentum must be removed or redistributed during the formation process. The angular momentum from the cloud can be removed by ambipolar diffusion. Yet the problem to go from the core to the star remains.

The specific angular momentum of typical star-forming molecular clouds are at least three orders of magnitude larger than the maximum speed at the equatorial plane of the star where the centrifugal force equals gravity. Thus, if we equals the centrifugal force per unit mass and gravity, we get
\begin{equation}
  \frac{v^2_\textrm{break up}}{R_\star} = \frac{GM_\star}{R_\star^2}
  \Rightarrow v_\textrm{break up} = R_\star \Omega_\textrm{break up} = \sqrt{\frac{GM_\star}{R_\star}}
  \Rightarrow \Omega_\textrm{break up} = \sqrt{\frac{GM_\star}{R_\star^3}}
\end{equation}

For a typical T Tauri star, the break up value is one to a few hundreds \si{\km\per\s} while those stars rotate at around \SIrange{5}{20}{\km\per\s}. The stellar rotation is an order of magnitude bellow the break up velocity.

Here are some recent \textbf{Kepler} mission measurements of rotation in clusters.
\fxnote{Missing figure}
These results can be compared to Bouvier et al. results hereafter, showing plots of the evolution of the rotation as a function of time for Fast Rotators (blue lines) and Slow Rotators (red lines). The envelope velocity is always slower than the core velocity. The circle on the right is the position of our Sun. The curves correspond to evolutionary tracks and are model dependant.

\fxnote{Missing plots}

In the case of a Keplerian disk, to the first order, the centrifugal force balances gravity $\rho \frac{v_\phi^2}{r} \approx \rho \frac{GM_\star}{r^2}$. Thus, similarly to the break up velocity we get the Keplerian velocity and angular frequency:
\begin{equation}
  v_\phi = \sqrt{\frac{GM_\star}{r}}, \quad \Omega = \frac{v_\phi}{r} = \sqrt{\frac{GM_\star}{r^3}}
\end{equation}
\fxnote{Missing scheme}

If the disk edge is connected onto the star as on the above scheme, they should rotate at the same speed on the boundary layer and the star should thus rotate at its breakup velocity. As this is not the case, it is obvious that the star cannot be directly connected to the disk and that some mechanism should exist to evacuate the angular momentum. One solution to this problem is the disk-locking mechanism, where the angular momentum of the star is transferred to the disk \emph{via} the magnetosphere and then the viscosity of the disk removes the excess of angular momentum. Another solution is that the stellar wind itself carries away angular momentum while being braked by the magnetic field.
\subsubsection{Rotation of AGN and Microquasar Central Black Hole}
The problem of the transfer of angular momentum to the black hole in the accretion disk is similar to the one in YSO. All black holes are surely not maximally rotating, for instance the Galactic Black Hole of the disk luminosity shown on next figure is rotating at 0.6 its maximum angular velocity.

If the mass of a Kerr black hole is $M$, its angular momentum $J$, its Schwarzschild radius is
\begin{equation}
  R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\end{equation}
and the radius of the horizon is:
\begin{equation}
  R_\mathrm{Kerr} = \frac{Rs}{2} \left( 1 + \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{Jc}{GM^2} \right)^2 } \right)
\end{equation}
The angular momentum cannot be higher than the value that makes the square root negative, so
\begin{equation}
  J < J_\mathrm{max} = \frac{GM^2}{c} = MR_\mathrm{Kerr}c
\end{equation}
We define the rotation parameter as:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{J}{J_\mathrm{max}} < 1
\end{equation}

How do we know the nature of the central black hole in AGNs? The main clue comes from the iron-K line which can be explained only with a central rotating black hole.

\fxnote{Missing figure}

The red component of the line is the signature of general relativity effects due to the BH. It is explained by the gravitational redshift (Einstein effect) in addition to special-relativity Doppler shift and beaming, as shown on the following figure of a synthetic Iron K Line produced by a rotating accretion disk around a BH.

\fxnote{Missing figure}

The line profile can be modelled using a Schwarzschild BH or a non rotating BH (below left). The discrepancies can be reduced by keeping the Schwarzschild BH, but taking into account the reflected continuum (below right).

\fxnote{Missing figure}

However, it seems the best fit is obtained by considering a rotating BH, or Kerr BH in maximal rotation.

The last figure is generated for a maximally rotating Kerr BH. Note the absence of the dotted line on the right part.
\subsubsection{Conclusion, The Global Picture of the Jet}

In conclusion, the system we have is a rotating disk and a central
object. The plasma is ionized. We have all the ingredients to have a complex
structure involving rotation and magnetic field.

\section{Thermal Accretion and Winds}
Because of rotation and magnetic fields, accretion and ejection are 3-dimensional and close to axisymmetry. However, some of the basic features can be under understood by looking a 1-dimensional processes and especially spherically-symmetric accretion and wind.
\subsection{Spherical Accretion and Wind}
\subsubsection{Bondi Accretion}
Let's consider an ideal fluid around a star in-falling (accretion), with a spherical symmetry. Using spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$ we write the physical variables describing the fluid :
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \rho(r),\quad P = P(r), \quad \vv{v} = \vv{v}(r)
\end{equation}
The conservation of energy gives:
\begin{equation}
  E = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + h + \Phi_\mathrm{grav}
\end{equation}
For the sake of simplicity, let's assume the flow is isothermal. The gravitational potential is
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_\mathrm{grav} = - \frac{GM_\star}{r},\quad \textrm{$M_\star$ is the mass of the star}
\end{equation}
and the enthalpy is:
\begin{equation}
  h = \int \frac{\d p}{\rho} = c_s^2 \ln \rho
\end{equation}
because the flow is isothermal. Here, $c_s^2 = 2 \frac{k_b T}{m_H}$ is the sound speed.

The conservation equations are written as follow:
\begin{equation}
  \tcboxmath{
    \begin{split}
      \vv{\nabla}\cdot \left( \rho\vv{v} \right) = 0, \quad& \textrm{Mass conservation}\\
      \rho v \frac{\d v}{\d r} = -\frac{\d p }{\d r} - \rho \frac{GM_\star}{r^2},\quad & \textrm{Euler equation}\\
      p = c_s^2 \rho,\quad & \textrm{Equation of state}
    \end{split}
  }
\end{equation}
The mass conservation equation gives:
\begin{equation}
  \rho v r^2 = \textrm{constant} = \dot{m}, \quad \textrm{$\dot{m}$ is the accretion rate}
\end{equation}

Rewriting the energy, we get :
\begin{align}
  E &= \frac{1}{2}v^2 + c_s^2 \ln \frac{\dot{m}}{vr^2} - \frac{GM}{r} \\
    &= \frac{c_s^2}{2}\left[ \frac{v^2}{c_s^2} + 2\ln \frac{\dot{m}}{vr^2} - \frac{2GM}{c_s^2r}\right] \\
    &= \frac{c_s^2}{2} \left[\frac{v^2}{c_s^2} + \ln \frac{c_s^2}{v^2} + 4\ln \frac{2GM}{c_s^2r} - \frac{2GM}{c_s^2r} + 2\ln \frac{\dot{m}c_s}{(2GM)^2} + 2\ln c_s^2\right]
\end{align}
Let $r_c = \frac{GM}{2c_s^2}$. The Bernoulli constant gives that the solutions are given implicitly by drawing the following isocontours:
\begin{equation}
  \tcboxmath{
    \left( \frac{v}{c_s} \right)^2 - \ln \left( \frac{v}{c_s} \right)^2 - 4\ln \frac{r}{r_c} - 4 \frac{r_c }{r} = C
  }
\end{equation}
where $C$ is a constant.

By deriving this equation or directly from Euler equation,
\begin{align}
  \rho v \frac{\d v}{\d r}  &= -c_s^2 \frac{\d \rho}{\d r} - \rho \frac{GM}{r^2} \\
  r \frac{v}{c_s^2} \frac{\d v}{\d r} &= \underbrace{-\frac{r}{\rho}\frac{\d \rho}{\d r}}_\textrm{mass conservation} - \frac{GM}{c_s^2r} \\
                            &= r \left( \frac{2}{r} + \frac{c_s}{v} \frac{\d(v/c_s)}{\d r} \right) - \frac{2r_c }{r} \\
  \frac{r}{r_c }\frac{v}{c_s }\frac{\d (v/c_s)}{\d (r/r_c)} & = \frac{r}{r_c} \left( \frac{2r_c }{r} + \frac{c_s}{v} \frac{\d(v/c_s)}{\d(r/r_c )} \right) - \frac{2r_c }{r}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:speed_eq}
  \tcboxmath{
    \left( \frac{v}{c_s} - \frac{c_s}{v} \right) \frac{\d \left( \frac{v}{c_s} \right) }{\d \left( \frac{r}{r_c } \right) } = 2 \frac{r_c}{r} \left( 1 - \frac{r_c }{r} \right)
  }
\end{equation}

The set of solutions of the previous equation is displayed on the two following figures. This is the topology of the solutions.

We note $M = \frac{v}{c_s}$ the Mach number.

We could show that for polytropic winds ($p = Kp^\gamma$), the topology of the Mach number doesn't change even though the sound speed is no longer a constant but depends on distance :
\begin{equation}
  c_s^2 = \frac{\d p}{\d \rho}
\end{equation}

A few years before Parker, Bondi (1952) proposed that accretion onto a star or a black hole could become supersonic. This corresponds to one of the 2 critical solutions. Of course, supersonic accretion onto the star ends by a shock, which explains X-ray emissions of cataclysmic binaries.

We can calculate for this solution the mass accretion rate, which is by definition
\begin{equation}
  \dot{M} = 4\pi r^2 \rho (-v) = 4\pi r_c^2 \rho_s c_s
\end{equation}
Evaluating the energy at the critical point :
\begin{equation}
  E = \textrm{constant} = \frac{1}{2}v^2 + c_s^2 \ln\rho - \frac{GM}{r} = \frac{1}{2}c_s^2 + c_s^2 \ln \rho_s - \frac{GM}{r_c}
\end{equation}
we get the velocity both at infinity and close to the star :
\begin{align}
  v^2 &= 2c_s^2 \left( -\frac{3}{2} + \ln \frac{\rho_s}{\rho} \right)  + \frac{2GM}{r} \\
      & \xrightarrow{r\to 0} \frac{2GM}{r} \\
      & \xrightarrow{r\to\infty} 0\ \Rightarrow \rho_S = \rho_\infty e^{3/2}
\end{align}

We see that close to the star, the fluid is in free fall. The mass accretion rate of the transsonic solution is thus:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{M}_\mathrm{transsonic} = \pi \left( GM \right)^2 e^{3/2} \frac{\rho_\infty}{c_s^3}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Parker wind or thermally driven outflow}
We now suppose that the ideal fluid around the star is out-flowing (wind). We assume spherical symmetry. Using the same spherical coordinates ($r, \theta, \phi$), we can derive the same equations with different boundary conditions. Here, conditions are given at the stellar surface and not at infinity. Again we have $\rho = \rho(r)$, $P = P(r)$, $\vv{v} = \vv{v}(r)$.

Even if the fluid is magnetized, the assumption of spherical symmetry implied that the magnetic field parallel to the stream does not give any contribution. The Poynting flux is zero.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume again that the flow is isothermal. The original Parker model for the solar wind already contained all the necessary ingredients ; it assumed the flow to be isothermal close to the sun and adiabatic farther away where the wind is accelerated.

The final set of equation is the same. Basically we solve:
\begin{equation}
  \tcboxmath{
    \left( \frac{v}{c_s} - \frac{c_s}{v} \right) \frac{\d \left( \frac{v}{c_s} \right) }{\d \left( \frac{r}{r_c } \right) } = 2 \frac{r_c}{r} \left( 1 - \frac{r_c }{r} \right)\quad \textrm{or} \quad
    \left( \frac{v}{c_s} \right)^2 - \ln \left( \frac{v}{c_s} \right)^2 - 4\ln \frac{r}{r_c }- 4 \frac{r_c}{r} = C
  }
\end{equation}
The topology of the solutions is the same as previously but with a new interpretation. We can also plot in 3D the energy versus distance and velocity to make clear the critical point is sitting on a saddle. We still have $M = \frac{v}{c_s}$ the Mach number. We see that the r.h.s. of \eqref{eq:speed_eq} vanishes for $r=r_c$ and the l.h.s. for $v=v_s$ except if the flow has reached super sonic speed at the critical radius. Thus solutions have an horizontal or a vertical tangent except for the two critical solutions where there is \textbf{a fixed or critical point}. This is a \textbf{saddle} point\footnote{The two slopes of the critical solutions at the critical point can be determined using l'Hospital's rule, i.e. expanding $\frac{v}{c_s} = 1 + \delta$ and $\frac{r}{r_c} = 1 + \varepsilon$ to first order. We obtain a second algebraic equation for the slope $\delta/\varepsilon$ which solutions are the slopes at the saddle point,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\delta}{\varepsilon} = \frac{\d (v/c_s)}{\d (r/r_c)} = \frac{2 \frac{r_c }{r}\left( 1 - \frac{r_c }{r} \right) }{\frac{v}{c_s} - \frac{c_s}{v}} = \frac{2 \frac{1}{1+\varepsilon} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1+\varepsilon} \right) }{1 + \delta - \frac{1}{1+\delta}} \approx \frac{2(1-\varepsilon)\varepsilon}{1 + \delta - 1 + \delta} \approx \frac{2\varepsilon}{2\delta} \Rightarrow \frac{\delta}{\varepsilon} = \pm 1
\end{equation*}} with two slopes. The saddle nature of the point is better seen in the 3D plot of the energy in phase space ($r, v$).

\subsubsection{Solar wind (Parker 1958)}
The breeze solutions have zero velocity asymptotically, but the pressure is non zero and cannot match the interstellar pressure :
\begin{equation}
  v^2 = 2 c_s^2 \left( -\frac{3}{2} + \ln \frac{\rho_s}{\rho} \right) + \frac{2GM}{r} \xrightarrow{r\to\infty} 0\Rightarrow \rho_\infty = \rho_s e^{-3/2} \neq 0 \Rightarrow \rho_\infty \neq 0
\end{equation}
Thus they are very similar in behavior to the static solutions, which we have shown to be excluded. Parker showed that the only valid solution is the critical solution that becomes super sonic with zero pressure at infinity. It has then been confirmed observationnaly. Parker also showed studying the polytropic wind that acceleration can be obtained only if the polytropic index is $\gamma < \frac{3}{2}$. $\frac{c_p}{c_s} = \frac{5}{3}$ being the adiabatic value for a monoatomic gas, this means that the exists only because there is enough extended heating at the base of the solar corona.

There are some breeze solutions with heat conduction, which have zero pressure at infinity. Thus the debate was really strong during the 60s, until observations confirmed Parker's theory. Nowadays, the problem has slightly shifted. In fact for a temperature of one million Kelvin, the speed at the earth orbit is of the order of \SI{500}{\km\per\s} with this model. From the measurements of Ulysses spacecraft, we know that this is effectively the speed of the slow equatorial wind, but this model is not sufficient to explain the \SI{800}{\km\per\s} of the fast polar wind. Thus, series of models have been developed which involve sophisticated not-so-well-known coronal heating, kinetic theories, etc... is still an open debate.

Similarly to the accretion rate, one can calculate the mass loss rate from the star through the wind:
\begin{align}
  \dot{M} & = 4\pi r^2\rho v = 4\pi r^2_c\rho_sc_s \\
  \dot{M}_\odot & = \SI{e-14}{M_\odot\per\s} \\
  \dot{M}_\mathrm{TTauri} &= \SI{e-8}{M_\odot\per\s}
\end{align}

The critical point corresponds to sonic waves . The stellar surface losses mass in a steady
way only if the mass flux  adapts itself to cross the critical surface. The sonic waves going
upstream will make the ejection to evolve until it reaches the steady state. This critical surface
is analogous to the event horizon around black holes. Beyond this surface, the wind is unable
to propagate sound waves back to the source.

There is a strong analogy between the sonic surface and apparent horizon in black holes,
except that the sound speed  replaces the speed of light. This is illustrated in the following
figures.

\fxnote{Missing figure}

If the star rotates, in addition to the sonic surface/horizon there is also an acoustic ergosphere.


\subsubsection{De Laval Nozzle}

There is a strong analogy between the Parker wind and a flow through a nozzle. A nozzle is a
pipe with a variable cross section. It has a minimum and this minimum should coincide with the
sonic point to have strong supersonic flow,

\fxnote{Missing Figure}

Mass conservation :

\begin{equation}
  \vv{\nabla}\cdot(\rho\vv{v}) \Rightarrow \int \rho\vv{v}\cdot \d \vv{S} = cst \Rightarrow \rho vS = cst
  \Rightarrow \frac{\d \rho}{\rho} + \frac{\d \nu}{\nu} + \frac{\d S}{S} = 0
\end{equation}

Euler equation:
 \begin{equation}
  \rho v \frac{\d v}{\d x} = -\frac{\d p}{\d x}
\end{equation}
Equation of state (energy) :
\begin{equation}
  p(x) = c_{s}^2\rho(x)
\end{equation}
 It follows:
\begin{equation}
  v\frac{\d v}{\d x} = -c_s^2\frac{\d\rho}{\rho \d x} = c_s^2\left(\frac{\d v}{v\d x}+\frac{\d S}{S\d x}\right)
  \Rightarrow \left( v - \frac{c_s^2}{v} \right)\frac{\d v}{\d x} = c_s^2\frac{\d S}{S \d x}
\end{equation}

The flow can be transonic only if $\frac{\d S}{S\d x} = 0 $ which means that the cross section
has an extremum. It is by default a minimum as at the entrance of the nozzle on the left,  $v<c_s$ and
$\frac{\d v}{\d x} > 0$ thus $\frac{\d S}{\d x} > 0 $. If this minimum exists, to be transsonic the flow must
attain the sound speed at the minimum cross section.

\paragraph{Spherical flow, Parker wind}

For a spherical wind we have:
\begin{equation}
  \left( v - \frac{c_s^2}{v}  \right)\frac{\d v}{\d r} = c_s^2\frac{\d S}{S\d r}
  = \frac{2c_s^2}{r} - \frac{GM}{r^2} \Rightarrow \frac{\d \ln S}{\d r} =
  \frac{2}{r} - \frac{GM}{c_s^2 r2}
  \Rightarrow \ln S = \ln r^2 +\frac{GM}{c_s^2r} + k
\end{equation}

And finally:

\begin{equation}
  \tcboxmath{S = Cr^2 \exp\left(\frac{GM}{c_s^2 r}\right)}
\end{equation}

Gravity plays the role of reducing the effective cross sectionas te radial flux tubes expands
as $r^2$. There is no real throat just an effect of gravity.

\paragraph{Funnel ans 1D flow}
The analogy has been used to explain jets both in the YSO  and the AGN contexts. The argument
is to use the presence of the surrounding thick disk close to the central object has shaped in
the form a funnel.

This is the case of the famous \textbf{ Exhaust Model for AGN Jets} suggested by
Blandford  \&  Rees 1974 (see correct figure), used also in the Ion Supported Torus
model of jet funnel by Phinney 1999 (see other correct figure).

\fxnote{Missing Figure}

Raga and Canto also used this model in 1989 for YSO, invoking a stellar wind to make
the cavity.

\fxnote{Missing figure}

These models suffer strong flaws. The shape of the funnel is somewhat given and
not the result of a really consistent resolution of the MHD equations. The strongest argument
is however that the throat of the funnel is always too far from the central object to maintain
a very small opening angle for the jet.

This leads us to next chapterand to consider axisymmetric models ans not only 1D solutions.

\subsubsection{Vertical structure of a Thin Keplerian Disk}

\section{Theory of Standard Accretion Disks}

\subsection{Shakura Sunyaev Standard Thin Disk}

\subsubsection{Thin Accretion Disk}

\FIXME{Missing figure}

We assume a thin disk as previously Keplerian to first order where the height
can be neglected. In other words we integrate all equations on an annulus $R$
over the height of the disk $H(R)$. First we write mass conservation,
\begin{equation*}
  \diffp{\rho}{t} + \vv{\nabla}\cdot(\rho \vv{v}) = 0
\end{equation*}

Introducing the surface mass density defined as
\begin{equation*}
    \Sigma = \int_{-H}^H \rho \d{z} \approx 2 \rho H
\end{equation*}

so that $2 \pi R \Sigma$ is the mass density per unit length. Integrating the
mass conservation over H (the integral and the derivative being linear and here
independant operators, they can be inverted),
\begin{align*}
    \int_{-H}^H \left( \diffp{\rho}{t} + \vv{\nabla}\cdot(\rho \vv{v}) \right) = 0 % Not a mistake, just for code readability
    &= \diffp{\int_{-H}^H \rho \d{z}}{t} + \vv{\nabla}\cdot\left( \int_{-H}^H \rho \vv{v} \d{z} \right) \\
    &= \diffp{\int_{-H}^H \rho \d{z}}{t} + \vv{\nabla}\cdot\left( \vv{v} \int_{-H}^H \rho \d{z} \right) \\
    &= \diffp{\Sigma z}{t} + \vv{\nabla}\cdot(\Sigma V_R)
\end{align*}

we get mass conservation on each annulus:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alpha_mass}
    \tcboxmath{
        \diffp{\Sigma}{t} + \frac{1}{R} \diffp{(R \Sigma V_R)}{R} = 0
    }
\end{equation}

We assume quasi-Keplerian rotation $V_\varphi = R \Omega_K = \sqrt{\frac{G
M}{R}}$. In reality rotation is slightly sub-Keplerian to allow accretion.

We then use the Angular Momentum conservation, which comes from the global
momentum equation,
\begin{equation*}
  \rho \diffp{\vv{v}}{t} + \rho (\vv{v}\cdot\vv{\nabla})\vv{v} =
  \rho \vv{g} - \vv{\nabla} p - \vv{\nabla}\cdot\left(\rho \overline{\vv{v'} \otimes \vv{v'}}\right) \quad \text{with} \quad V_\varphi \leq R \Omega_K
\end{equation*}

Momentum equation can be written with a turbulent pressure tensor
\begin{equation*}
  \diffp{}{t}(\rho \vv{v}) + \vv{\nabla}\cdot\left(\rho \vv{v} \otimes \vv{v} + \tens{P}_{turb}\right) = \rho \vv{g}
\end{equation*}

\FIXME{Need of a better tensorial notation for Pturb}

with the turbulent pressure being
\begin{align*}
    \tens{P}_\mathrm{turb} &= p_\mathrm{gas} \tens{I} + \rho \overline{\vv{v}' \otimes \vv{v}'} \\
    \left(\overline{\vv{v}' \otimes \vv{v}'}\right)_{ij} &= \overline{v_i' v_j'} =
    - \nu_T \left( \diffp{\overline{v_i}}{{x_j}} + \diffp{\overline{v_j}}{{x_i}} \right) \\
    \Leftrightarrow \left(\overline{\vv{v}' \otimes \vv{v}'}\right) &=
    - \nu_T \left(\vv{\nabla} \otimes \vv{v} + \vv{v} \otimes \vv{\nabla}\right)
\end{align*}

\FIXME{Same as above}

The molecular viscosity is completely inefficient and cannot explain the source
of viscosity essential to have accretion,
\begin{equation*}
    \mathfrak{R}_\mathrm{e} = \frac{L^2}{\nu T} = \frac{L V}{\nu} \approx \num{e11}
\end{equation*}

Shakura \& Sunyaev suggested then (1971) that the source of viscosity is
turbulence giving an anomalous coefficient for the viscosity.
\begin{equation*}
    \mathfrak{R}_\mathrm{eT} = \frac{L^2}{\nu_T T} = \frac{L V}{\nu_T} \approx \num{e4}
\end{equation*}

\FIXME{Make it a reference}

To explain this turbulence one needs the disk to develop instabilities. Since
Balbus \& Hawley (1991), the instability most favorable seems to be the
Magneto-Rotational-Instabililty (MRI hereafter).

\FIXME{Make it a reference}

To get the angular momentum conservation on $\phi$, we can multiply by $\vv{R} \times$, and integrate over height,
\begin{align*}
    &\int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \diffp{}{t}(\rho \vv{v}) \d{z} +
    \int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \vv{\nabla} \cdot \left(\rho \vv{v} \otimes \vv{v} + \tens{P}_{turb}\right) \d{z} =
    \underbrace{\int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \rho \vv{\nabla} \nabla_{grav} \d{z}}_{= 0} \\
    &\Rightarrow \diffp{}{t} \int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times (\rho \vv{v}) \d{z} +
    \vv{\nabla} \cdot \int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \left( \rho \vv{v} \otimes \vv{v} \right) \d{z} +
    \underbrace{\int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \vv{\nabla} p \d{z}}_{= 0} =
    - \vv{\nabla} \cdot \int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \left(\overline{\rho \vv{v}' \otimes \vv{v}'}\right) \d{z}
\end{align*}

See the appendix for the correctness of operators inversion.

\FIXME{Add this appendix, link it}

\begin{equation*}
    \Rightarrow \diffp{}{t} \int_{-H}^H \rho R V_\varphi \d{z} + \frac{1}{R} \diffp{}{R} \left( R \int_{-H}^H R \rho V_R V_\varphi \d{z} \right) =
    \frac{1}{R} \diffp{}{R} \left( R G \right)
\end{equation*}

We get,
\begin{equation*}
    \diffp{\left(\Sigma R V_\varphi\right)}{t} + \frac{1}{R} \diffp{R V_R \Sigma R V_\varphi}{R} = \frac{1}{R} \diffp{RG}{R}
\end{equation*}

We replace the rotational speed with the Keplerian laws as the flow is supposed to be quasi-Keplerian,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alpha_moment}
    \tcboxmath{
        \diffp{\Sigma R^2 \Omega}{t} + \frac{1}{R} \diffp{R V_R \Sigma R^2 \Omega}{R} = \frac{1}{R} \diffp{RG}{R}
    }
\end{equation}

The turbulence viscous torque is given by,
\begin{align*}
    & \overleftrightarrow{G} = - \int_{-H}^H \vv{R} \times \left( \overline{\rho \vv{v}' \otimes \vv{v}'} \right) \d{z} =
    \nu_T \vv{R} \times \int_{-H}^H \rho \left(\vv{\nabla} \otimes \vv{v} + \vv{v} \otimes \vv{\nabla} \right) \d{z} \\
    & \Rightarrow G = \nu_T R \int_{-H}^{H} \rho R \diffp{}{R} \frac{V_\varphi}{R} \d{z}
\end{align*}

The second line being the $\varphi$ compound, only interesting one regarding
$\vv{\nabla} \cdot \overleftrightarrow{G} \cdot \vv*{e}{z}$, which reduces in our simple
case to the following scalar,
\begin{equation*}
    \Rightarrow G = \nu_T R \int_{-H}^H R \diffp{}{R} \left( \frac{V_\varphi}{R} \right) \rho \d{z} \diffp{}{R} \left(\frac{R \Omega}{R}\right)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        G(R,t) = \nu_T \Sigma R^2 \diffp{\Omega}{R}
    }
\end{equation}

The anomalous coefficient of viscosity if coming from turbulence should be
proportional to the sound speed at which instabilities propagate and to the
local scale height of the disk,
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        \nu_T = \alpha c_s H
    }
\end{equation}

The $\alpha$ coefficient explan the name $\alpha$-disk given to these disks.

Combining \cref{eq:alpha_mass,eq:alpha_moment} with the Keplerian law,
$V_\varphi \approx R \Omega_K$, we finally obtain,
\begin{align*}
    \diffp{\Sigma}{t} &= \frac{3}{R} \diffp{}{R} \left( R^\frac{1}{2} \diffp{}{R} \left( \nu_T \Sigma R^\frac{1}{2} \right) \right) \\
    \nu_T &= \nu_T(\Omega,R,t)
\end{align*}

This is a non-linear diffusion equation with the typical viscous time and
accrection speed,
\begin{equation*}
    t_{vis} \approx \frac{R^2}{\nu_T} ; V_R = \frac{R}{t_{vis}} \approx \frac{\nu_T}{R}
\end{equation*}

The two previous equation must be finally combined to the $R$-component or
radial component of the momentum equation to get the pressure profile,
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        \diffp{V_R}{t} + V_R \diffp{V_R}{R} - \frac{V_\varphi^2}{R^2} = - \frac{GM}{R^2} - \frac{1}{\rho} \diffp{P}{R}
    }
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Steady Accretion Disk}

Assuming now that we have a steady state, we get the mass loss rate,
\begin{equation}
    \diffp{R \Sigma V_R}{R} = 0 \Leftrightarrow 2 \pi R \Sigma (- V_R) = cst = \dot{M}
\end{equation}

The angular momentum conservation that can be integrated
\begin{equation}
    \diffp{2 \pi R V_R \Sigma R^2 \Omega}{R} = \diffp{(2 \pi R G)}{R} \Leftrightarrow 2 \pi R V_R \Sigma R^2 \Omega = 2 \pi R G(R) + 2 \pi C
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
    R G(R) = - \frac{\dot{M}}{2 \pi} R^2 \Omega - C = - \frac{\dot{M}}{2 \pi} l - C
\end{equation*}

$l = R^2 \Omega$ is the specific angular momentum.
\begin{align*}
    & RG(R) = - \frac{\dot{M}}{2 \pi} (l - l_{in}) = R \nu_T \Sigma R^2 \diffp{\Omega}{R} \\
    & \Rightarrow \nu_T \Sigma = \frac{\dot{M}}{3 \pi} \left(1 - \frac{l_{in}}{l}\right) =
    \frac{\dot{M}}{3 \pi} \left(1 - \left(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
    &G(R_{in}) = 0 \Rightarrow C = - \frac{\dot{M}}{2 \pi} l_{in}
\end{align*}

Thus the accretion velocity is given by,
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        \Rightarrow V_R = - \frac{3 \nu_T}{2 R} \left(1 - \left(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1}
    }
\end{equation}

In a steady state, the energy diissipation occurs at the surface. The kinetic
energy of rotation is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \diff{E_c}{t} = \diff{\frac{1}{2} J \Omega^2}{t} = \frac{1}{2} G \Omega
\end{equation*}

The dissipation is the energy lost per unit surface and unit time
\begin{equation*}
    D(R) = \diff{E_c(R+\d{R}) - \d{E_c(R)}}{R \d{t}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} G \Omega(R+\d{R}) - \frac{1}{2} G \Omega(R)}{\d{R}} = \frac{G(R)}{2} \diffp{\Omega}{R}
\end{equation*}

Thus,
\begin{equation*}
    D(R) = \frac{1}{2} G(R) \diffp{\Omega}{R} = \frac{1}{2} \nu_T \Sigma \left( R \diffp{\Omega}{R} \right)^2 \underset{\Omega = \Omega_K}{\approx}
    \frac{3 G M \dot{M}}{8 \pi R^3} \left(1 - \left(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\right)^\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{equation*}

The total luminosity carries only half of the total gravitational energy. The
conversion is only \SI{50}{\percent}.
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        L_D = 2 \int_{R_{in}}^{\infty} 2 \pi R D(R) \d{R} = \frac{G M \dot{M}}{2 R_{in}} = \frac{1}{2} L_{acc}
    }
\end{equation}

The fate of the other \SI{50}{\percent} of energy depends on the nature of the
central object. If there is a real star (YSO, White Dwarf, Neutron Star…) the
other \SI{50}{\percent} is dissipated in the boundary layer in the form of a
shock. This is usually seen as bright spot (hot spot, X-rays, etc.). If the
central object is a Black Hole, this energy is lost by absorption.

Or…

In fact there is another way to dissipate this \SI{50}{\percent} left which is
the presence of an outflow, collimated or not into a jet. An outflow might be
sufficient and there is no need for collimation.

\subsubsection{Self-consistency}

In the following by looking at the order of magnitude in the vertical and
radial equilibrium, we verify that our assumptions are at least
self-consistent.

Along $z$, we write the vertical momentum equation
\begin{equation}
    0 = - \frac{G M z} {R^3} - \frac{1}{\rho} \diffp{P}{z} \Rightarrow \frac{H}{R} \approx c_s \sqrt{\frac{R}{G M}} \approx \frac{c_s}{V_K}
\end{equation}

This equation implies that the Keplerian speed of the rotation should be supersonic.
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        \Rightarrow V_K \gg c_s
    }
\end{equation}

Along $R$, we wirte the radial momentum equation
\begin{equation}
    \diffp{V_R}{t} + V_R \diffp{V_R}{R} - \frac{V_\varphi^2}{R^2} = - \frac{G M}{R^2} - \frac{1}{\rho} \diffp{P}{R}
\end{equation}

This,
\begin{align*}
    & \frac{1}{\rho} \diffp{P}{R} = \frac{c_s^2}{R} \ll \frac{G M}{R^2} = \frac{V_\varphi^2}{R^2} \\
    & V_R \approx \frac{\nu_T}{R} = \frac{\alpha c_s H}{R} \\
    & V_R \diffp{V_R}{R} \approx \frac{V_R^2}{R} \approx \alpha^2 \frac{c_s^2}{R} \left(\frac{H}{R}\right)^2 \ll 1\\
    & V_\varphi = R \Omega_K \left(1 + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{c_s^2}{V_\varphi^2}\right) \right) \\
    & \frac{H}{R} \approx \frac{c_s}{V_\varphi}
\end{align*}

This implies that the radial speed of the accretion is subsonic.
\begin{equation}
    \tcboxmath{
        \Rightarrow \frac{V_R}{c_s} \approx \alpha \frac{H}{R} \approx \alpha \frac{c_s}{V_\varphi} \ll 1
    }
\end{equation}

And % Yes, the course stop here like that. Asking the teacher…

\subsection{Origin of Turbulence in Standard Thin Disks}

turbulence comes from instabilities, For a weakly magnetized disk, magneto-rotational instability is a good candidate.
This instability was first studied bu Balbus and Hawley  (1991) in the context of accretion disk, though the
magneto-rotational was already formally described earlier by Russain groups. in the context of disks, 
it is a rather important instability because it may explain the origin of turbulence and allows to estimate 
the turbulent vicosity  and the turbulent magnetic diffusity in those objects. 

\FIXME{fix references in next paragraph}

The system is an accretion disk around a star as seen on Fig.XXX below, thread by a vertical homogeneous field
$\vec{B_o} = B_z\vec{e_z}$ such that the Lorents force is zero, using cylindrical coordinates $[r,\theta,\phi]$.
Thus gravity is balanced only by the centrifugal force. The disk rotates  at the Keplerian speed. The angular 
velocity is thus $\Omega = \frac{v_{\phi}}{r} = \sqrt{\frac{Gm_*}{r^3}}$  (see III.2.2.3). The magnetic fiels 
is frozen  in the plasma. it is easy to verify that the induction equation is trivially satisfied.

\FIXME{Missing figure}

In the initial non pertubed state, let consider three distanes sorted as follow $r_1 < r_0 < r_2 $. At 
each point, gravity balances the centrifugal fore  such that we can writte : 
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\frac{Gm}{r_1^2} = \frac{r_1^2\Omega_1^2}{r_1}}_{\text{at positon  } r_1} > 
\underbrace{\frac{Gm}{r_0^2} = \frac{r_0^2\Omega_0^2}{r_0}}_{\text{at position }r_0 > r_1}	>
\underbrace{\frac{Gm}{r_2^2} = \frac{r_2^2\Omega_2^2}{r_2}}_{\text{at position }r_2 > r_0}	
\end{equation}

This just expresses that gravity decreases outward, thus the rotational speed as well. The gravitational 
force pushing inward (i.e $-\vec{e_r}$), and the centrifugal force  outward as it can be seen in the vector
form of the force balance :
\begin{equation}
-\rho\frac{Gm}{r^2}\vec{e_r} + \rho\frac{v_{\phi}^2}{r}\vec{e_r} = \vec{0}
\end{equation}

Now  on b) the system is perturbed. Point 1 comes from $r_0$ to $r_1$ and point 2 from 
$r_0$ to $r_2$. The key point here, contrarily to the centrifugal instability explaines in 
IV.3.3, is the flux freezing . It implies thath for sufficiently strong vertial fields this is not 
the angular momentum $ L$ which is conserved because it can be exchanged with the magnetic field,
but the angular velocity $\Omega$. Thus point 1 is pushed inwards toward the star where 
gravity is stronger but keeping its initial angular speed $\Omega_0$. Thus we immediatly get 
for point 1 : 
\begin{equation}
f_{gravity,1} = \frac{Gm}{r_1^2} = \frac{r_1^2\Omega_1^2	}{r_1} > 
\frac{r_1^2\Omega_0^2}{r_1} = f_{centrifugal,1}
\end{equation}

There, gravity is larger than the centrifugal force and pushes 1 further  down toward the centre. 
Conversely point 2 is pushed further out because there the opposite holds : 

\begin{equation}
f_{gravity,2} = \frac{Gm}{r_2^2} = \frac{r_2^2\Omega_2^2	}{r_2} < 
\frac{r_2^2\Omega_0^2}{r_2} = f_{centrifugal,2}
\end{equation}

\FIXME{Missing figure}

The end result is that the system is unstable and the perturbation develops. Of course the magnetic
tension of the poloidal field will limit the growth of the instability. This is why the unstability is usually
quoted to be efficient in weakly magnetized disks

A more quantitative analysis shows that the system  is unstable if : 
\begin{equation}
\tcboxmath{\frac{d\Omega^2}{dr} < 0 \Rightarrow \text{unstable}}
\end{equation}

Thus, the rotation in a star is usuallly such that the star is not affected, while Keplerian
disk are likely to be highly unstable  to this unstability. This unstability as a source of 
turbulence gives a  nice ans natural explanation of the alpha vicosity  used in the standard
Shakura-Sunyaev thin accretion disk model. In such a case,  the origin of turbulence is also 
the origin of the magnetic diffusity and the magnetic Prandtl number (The ratio of the viscosity to magnetic
diffusity) should be close to one. In which case, the magnetic field cannot be accreted with matter because it
diffuses through the lines. However it may still be accreted if angular momentum is removed not by viscosity
but by an outflowing  magneto-centrifugally driven disk wind. For those interested, the original paper by Balbus
and Hawley, ApJ, 1991, is easy to read anf gives details on both the qualitative as well as the linear 
analysis of the instability.


\subsection{Radiation Supported Thin Disk}

Now that we have explored the possibility of a thin accretion disk, let's calculate the thickness 
of such a disk provided taht it is entirely supported by radiation from the disk itself.

We use the following notation for the mass density and the temperature on the equatorial  plane : 

\begin{align}
	& \rho_c = \rho(z=0) = \frac{\Sigma}{2H} \\
	& T-c = T(z=0)
\end{align}

The sound speed is : $c_s^2 = \frac{p}{\rho}$ with a total (scalar) pressure : 
\begin{equation}
P = P_{gas} + P_{rad}  = \rho \frac{k_b T_c}{\mu m_H} + \frac{4\sigma}{3 c}T_c^4
\end{equation}

if radiation dominates over the plasma gas pressure then we get : 
\begin{equation}
P_{gas} = \rho \frac{k_b T_c}{\mu m_H} << P_{rad} = \frac{u_{rad}}{3} = \frac{4\sigma}{3 c}T_c^4`
\end{equation}

The ful energy equation gives : 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t } \bigg (
\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + u + \rho \Phi_{grav} + u_{rad} \bigg) + 
\vec{\nabla}.\bigg(  
\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 \vec{v} + (u + p)\vec{v} + \rho \Phi_{grav}\vec{v} + 
\vec{q} - \tens{\sigma}_{visc}.\vec{v} + \vec{S}_{rad}
\bigg) = 0
\end{equation}

Assume steady state and radiatively dominated. if the disk is thin, the horizontal gradients
are negligible compared to horizontal ones.

\begin{equation}	
\diff{p}{R} << \diff{p}{z}, \diff{T}{R} << \diff{T}{z}\text{  etc}
\end{equation}
Thus we have : 
\begin{equation}
 \left.
    \begin{array}{ll}
        & \vec{\nabla}.\big( \vec{q}+\vec{S}_{rad}-\tens{\sigma}_{visc}\cdot\vec{v}\big)\\
        & \vec{q} << \vec{S}_{rad}
    \end{array}
\right \}\Rightarrow \vec{\nabla}\cdot\big(\vec{S}_{rad}-\tens{\sigma}_{visc}\cdot\vec{v}\big) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\vec{S}_{rad}(H) - \tens{\sigma}_{visc}\cdot\vec{v}(H) = \vec{S}_{rad}(0) - \tens{\sigma}_{visc}\cdot\vec{v}(0) \Leftrightarrow
S_{rad}(H) = D
\end{equation}
where : 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

Radiative energy flux in the diffusion approximation 
\begin{equation}
S_{rad}(z) = -\frac{4\sigma}{3\kappa_R \rho}\frac{\partial T^4}{\partial	z}
\end{equation}
Note that $\displaystyle S_{rad}(z) = \chi_{rad} \frac{\partial T }{\partial z } $ with $\displaystyle\chi_{rad} = \frac{16 \sigma T^3}{3\kappa_R \rho}$ 

$\kappa_R$ is the Rosseland opacity. This is valid only for optically thick disks obviously.

The optical thickness is given by : 
\begin{equation}
\tau = \rho H \kappa_R(\rho ,T) = \frac{\Sigma}{2} \kappa_R
\end{equation}
We can then calculate the radiative flux : 
\begin{align}
& S_{rad}(0) = 0 \text{  ;  } T(H)<<T(0) = T_c = max  \\
& S_{rad}(H) = -\frac{4\sigma}{3\kappa_R \rho}\frac{T^4(H)-T^4(0)}{H} 
\approx   \frac{4\sigma}{3\kappa_R \rho}\frac{T^4_c}{H} \\
& S_{rad}(H) \approx  \frac{4\sigma}{3\kappa_R \rho}\frac{T^4_c}{H} =
\frac{4\sigma}{3\tau}T_c^4 = D(R) \\
& \frac{4\sigma}{3\kappa_R \rho}T^4_c\underset{\mathrm{\Omega = \Omega_K}}{\approx}
\frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi R^3}\bigg(  1-\bigg(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\bigg)^{1/2}\bigg) \\
&c_s^2 = \frac{p}{\rho} = H^2\Omega^2 \Rightarrow H = \frac{3\dot{M}\sigma}{8\pi m_H c }
\bigg(  1-\bigg(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\bigg)^{1/2} \bigg)
\end{align}

Each annulus of the disk radiates at the effective temperature
\begin{equation}
\tcboxmath{
 \frac{4\sigma}{3\tau}T^4_c\underset{\mathrm{\Omega = \Omega_K}}{\approx}
 \frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi R^3}\bigg(  1-\bigg(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\bigg)^{1/2}\bigg) = 
 \sigma T_{eff}^4 
}
\end{equation}
The effective temperature is obtained from the following equation : 
\begin{equation}
\tcboxmath{
T_{eff} = \Bigg( \frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi \sigma R^3}
\bigg(  1-\bigg(\frac{R_{in}}{R}\bigg)^{1/2}\bigg)\Bigg)^{1/4}
\underset{\mathrm{R >>R_{in}}}{\rightarrow} T_{in}\bigg(\frac{R}{R_{in}}\bigg)^{-3/4}
}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
& T_{in} = \frac{3GM\dot{M}}{8\pi\sigma R^3}^{1/4} \\
& T^{max}_{eff} = T_{in} \bigg(\frac{49 R_{in}}{36}\bigg) = 0.488T_{in} \\ 
& \sim 0.488\times7.5.10^3 \bigg( \frac{\dot{M}}{\SI{e16}{\gram \per \s}}\bigg)^{1/4}
\bigg( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\bigg)^{1/4} 
\bigg(  \frac{R}{\SI{e11}{\cm}}\bigg)^{1/4} \quad \text{K(YSO)}     \\
& \sim 0.488\times 4.1.10^4 \bigg( \frac{\dot{M}}{\SI{e16}{\gram \per \s}}\bigg)^{1/4}
\bigg( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\bigg)^{1/4} 
\bigg(  \frac{R}{\SI{e9}{\cm}}\bigg)^{1/4} \quad \text{K(WD)}     \\
& \sim 0.488\times 5.10^6  \bigg( \frac{\dot{M}}{\SI{e17}{\gram \per \s}}\bigg)^{1/4}
\bigg( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\bigg)^{1/4} 
\bigg(  \frac{R}{\SI{e6}{\cm}}\bigg)^{1/4} \quad \text{K(NS)}     \\
&\sim 0.488 \times 10^5 \bigg(  \frac{\dot{M}}{\dot{M}_{Edd}}\bigg)^{1/4} 
\bigg( \frac{M}{10^6 M_{\odot}}\bigg)^{1/4}
\bigg(  \frac{R}{R_G}\bigg)^{1/4} \text{K(AGN)}
\end{align}

The Eddington accretion rate luminosity can be calculated accordingly by : 
\begin{equation}
\dot{M}_{Edd} = \frac{L_{Edd}}{c^2} \text{ ; } L_{Edd} = \frac{4\pi GMm_Hc}{\sigma_T}
\bigg( \frac{M}{10^6M_{\odot}}\bigg) \si{\erg \per \s}
\end{equation}
The black body flux corresponding to that solution is : 
\begin{equation}	
F_{\nu} = \frac{2\pi \cos (i)}{D^2} \int_{R_{in}}^{R_{out}} I_{\nu}RdR \text{  ;  }
I_{\nu} = B_{\nu}\big[ T(R)\big] \\ 
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
F_{\nu} = \frac{4\pi \cos (i)h\nu}{c^2D^2} \int_{R_{in}}^{R_{out}}
\frac{RdR}{\exp^{h\nu/kT(R)}-1}
&\xrightarrow[\nu << \frac{kT(R_{out})}{h}]{} \nu^2  \\
& \xrightarrow[\nu >> \frac{kT(R_{in})}{h}]{} \frac{2\pi h \nu^3}{c^2}\exp ^{-h\nu/kT(R)}  \\
& \xrightarrow[\frac{kT(R_{out})}{h}<<\nu << \frac{kT(R_{in})}{h}]{} \nu^{1/3}
\end{align}


At low frequency the flux reduces to the Rayleigh Jeans regime whereas at 
high frequency we are in the Wien regime


\subsection{Advection Dominated disks and slim disks}
\subsection{Magnetized Accretion disks}

\section{Theory of Magnetized Outflows}
\subsection{Theory of Magnetized Jets}
\subsubsection{Axisymmetric Steady Jets}
\subsubsection{Magneto Centrifugally Driven Wind}
\subsection{Acceleration and Collimation}
\subsubsection{Magnetic Acceleration}
\FIXME{mettre references correctes}

Magnetic acceleration can take two forms as illustrated. Either the magnetic is strongly
azimuthal (roped) and then uncoils itself as a spring. This corresponds to Fig (Fig XXX)
and the plasma gun model where this is the uncoiling of the magnetic spring (magnetic pressure gradient)
which provokes the acceleration. The second possibility (Fig XXX) is the Blandford Payne mechanism, where the magnetic field
is strong enough to maintain the plasma frozen at least up to the Alfven surface. As it rotates the effect is similar to a bead
on a wire and if the line is sufficiently inclined the plasmas is accelerated.

\FIXME{missing figure}

Fig. a) Plasma Gun mechanism is the uncoiling spring. this acceleration has been observed in lasers experiments using z pinch configuration, Unfortunately, it usually implies large initial velocity.
Moreover, the strong toroidal field is the most unstable situation.

Fig b). The poynting flux is converted into kinetic acceleration. This mechanism needs strong pressure 
in order to have  a large mass loading, and it is not available on the axis where rotation ceased. 

\subsubsection{Thermal or Pressure Acceleration}
\FIXME{missing figure}

Another way to obtain strongly accelerated jet is to invoke the presence of pressure gradients 
like in the solar wind. A purely thermally driven wind gives temperatures too high.

\begin{align*}
  & T \sim \SI{10}{V^2} \\
  & \SI{e7}{K} \leftrightarrow	  \SI{1000}{\km\per \s } \\
  & \SI{e6}{K} \leftrightarrow \SI{20}{\km \per\s}  \\
  &\SIrange{e12}{e13}{K} \leftrightarrow  \SI{300000}{\km \per \s} \\
  & \Gamma \sim \numrange{3}{10}
\end{align*}

However to solve this problem, one can invoke the fact that as in the solar wind where the
effective temperature is ten times higher than the kinetic wind pressure, we may also argue
for jets that in addition to the kinetic temperature, the total pressure includes Ram, Alfven
or other wave pressure.


All this is consistant if the variation $\sim$ magnitude are reasonable.

\begin{equation}
P_\mathrm{ram} \sim \frac{\delta V^2}{V^2} \qquad
P_\mathrm{Alfven}	\sim \frac{\delta B^2}{b^2} \qquad
\frac{\delta V}{V } \text{ or } \frac{\delta B}{B} \sim 1
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Pressure of thermal Collimation}
Collimtation can be the result of externa pressure onto the jet.

\FIXME{Missing figure}

Such collimation is not efficient on long distances from the soures, and we need help from the magnetic field.

\subsubsection{Magnetic Collimation}
Because of rotation, the build-up of azimuthal magnetic field creates a pinching or so-called "hoop=stress"

\FIXME{Missing figure}

Basically the Lorentz force is given at large distances from the source by the curvature R of the line.
\begin{equation}
\vv{j} \times \vv{B} = \frac{B^2_{\phi}}{R}
\end{equation}

Usually the hoop-stress gives a TOO efficient collimation and a very narrow jet, especially if there is only a disk wind.
This is in favor of having a strong turbulent inner spine jet. This poses the electric current closure problem. In fact,
the electric current should close. it can close either out of the jet or more likely  on the axis. This demands again a
two component jets with a spine component  from the central part and outer disk wind.
\subsection{Steady vs Time dependent, Analytical vs Simulations}

\subsubsection{Analytical models are Steady}
The are different analytical models:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Meridional Self Similar} models have a dipolar magnetic flux, $A \propto \sin^2\theta$ They are necessarily thermally or pressure driven but well adapted to describe the jet axis and are usually an expansion with colatitiude of the equations.
\item \textbf{X-Wind} the come from the intermediate zone between the disk and the star. They are magnetocentrifugally driven. The disk should produce a fan wind which seems rather unstable.
 \item \textbf{Radial Self Similar} models use power laws, in particular for the magnetic flux $A \propto r^{-5/4}$. They are adapted for the external part of the jet and especially for Keplerian Disk Winds. They correspond to the case where boundaries can be neglected (in particular the inner and outer parts of the disk).

\fxnote{Missing figure}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Numerical simulations are Time-dependent}
Many different AMR MHD codes are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item AMRVAC (Toth 1996; Nool \& Keppens 2002)
\item BATSRUS (Powell et al. 1999)
\item RIEMANN (Balsara 2000)
\item FLASH (Fryxell et al. 2002)
\item Nirvana (Zeigler 2005)
\item RAMSES (Fromang et al. 2006)
\item PLUTO (Mignone et al. 2007)
\item AstroBEAR (Cunnigham et al. 2008)
\item ZEUS, ATHENA (Stone et al., 199?)
\end{itemize}
To quote Stone, ``we use Athena which implements slightly different algorithms from all of these. These differences can be important. Diversity of methods is good.''.

\paragraph{Steady solution:}

In order to obtain real steady solution, self similarity is a necessary hypothesis so far. This might be a problem with the boundary conditions and the ersatz for scaling as they are not always compatible, realistically.

\paragraph{Time dependant solutions:}

Numerical simulations cannot last forever because they empty the disk. They also use large numerical diffusivity and have various problems in scaling.

Here after are a few examples of such simulations showing the collation by magnetic hoop stress.

\fxnote{Missing figures}
Time dependant schemes are also good to study the origin of the instabilities, the effects of star or magnetospheric variability and the origin of knots and shocks.

\fxnote{Missing figures}

Here is an example of a Kelvin Helmholtz instability in a simulation of a double component AGN relativistic jet using AMRVAC, by Meliani et al.

\fxnote{missing nice figure here}

\section{Young Stars}

\subsection{Disk classification}
The first classification of low mass YSOs was based on their spectral index:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{\d \log (\nu F)}{\d \log \nu}
\end{equation}
where $F_\nu$ is the flux density.
\fxnote{Missing $\lambda = f(\lambda F_\lambda)$}
This spectral index is computed in the wavelength interval of \SIrange{2.2}{10}{\mu\m} (near infrared region). The IR excess is interpreted as the emission of the cold gas of the disk .Thus the index indicates how big is the IR excess and the importance of the disk in the spectrum.

\fxnote{Missing figures here}

Following Lad C.J. and Wiling B.A. (1986) and Andre et al. (1993), we split the sources in four classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Class 0} sources, undetectable at $\lambda < \SI{10}{\micro\m}$
\item \textbf{Class I} sources have $\alpha < 0.3$
\item \textbf{Flat spectrum} sources have $0.3 > \alpha > -0.3$
\item \textbf{Class II} sources have $-0.3 > \alpha > -1.6$
\item \textbf{Class III} sources have $\alpha < -1.6$
\end{itemize}

The accretion rate is not continuous during the life of the YS and various episodes are probably observed as Fu Ori and EXor outburst in the early stages (Class I phase or Class II).

\fxnote{Missing figure}

\subsubsection{Outflow classification}

This classifications obtained for disks can be associated to our present knowledge of outflows.
\fxnote{Missing figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Class 0, disk driven jet -- not star ? The stellar core is there but the star may not be formed yet and brightening. Circulation models or outer disk driven winds are most likely
\item Class I, disk driven jet. Keplerian inner disks play a major role in magentocentrifugally driving the jet
\item Class II, classical T-Tauri YSO jet. Depending on the power of the jet, the inner Keplerian disk, the star/disk boundary or the star itself may drive the jet.
\item Class III, YSO weak (line) T-Tauri stars may drive a stellar wind (as main sequence stars) or an invisible jet. The (gas) disk is no longer connected to the star but may still be present
\item Main sequence stars drive stellar winds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The classification as a signature of the evolution}

\subsubsection{Class 0}

Class 0 objects are characterized mostly by very powerful CO flows. Another nice example of a powerful molecular outflow, with its inner accretion disk. Note that the inner structure is no very different from some pictures of planetary nebulae.

\fxnote{Missing picture}

As illustrated below, there is an ``onion'' structure with a high velocity inner component (even in the submillimiter range not necessarily in optical) along the jet axis and a low component around.
\fxnote{Missing picture}

\subsubsection{Class I}

Nice images of the HH objects from the HST are coming from Class I objects where the star is still quite embedded.
\fxnote{Missing pictures}

The images of HH34, HH30, HH47 give a nice view at different scales. HH30 clearly shows the disk seen through illumination by the star. It gives this typical ``concave lens'' aspect, which may look like a Keplerian disk but this is not a proof (see \autoref{sec:counter_rotation}). This is the result of the central star illuminating the disk (these are class I objects).

Although the picture is not clear, HH30 has knots separated by a distance of a hundred \si{AU} which for a speed of a few \SI{100}{\km\per\s} corresponds to a time scale of \SI{1}{\year}. HH34 show knots every \SI{1000}{AU} corresponding to \SI{10}{\year}. (and also smaller scales of \SI{100}{AU} closer to the star). In fact, these time scales correspond to typical stellar cycles. On very large scales (HH47) the jet structure is more chaotic. This this last case, the central star is also more embedded.

In order to study the star variability with PLUTO, Matsakos et al. (2009) used variable injections of mass flux, to mimic the variability on \SI{10}{\year} (left side) and \SI{1}{\year} (right side). \SI{10}{\year} correspond to \SI{1000}{AU} which is compatible with the spacing of the knots in HH30, while a variability of \SI{1}{\year} would give a spacing of \SI{100}{AU} as seen in HH34. We see that if the stellar mass flux varies, shocks form and affect the whole jet, including the disk wind.
\fxnote{Missing picture}

Disks of Class I objects (seen in infra red, red contours in next figure) show very powerful molecular outflow associated with the previous HH objects and optical jets. Molecular outflows with mass loss rates of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{jet} = \SI{e-5}{M_\otimes\per\year}$, velocity of a few \SI{10}{\km\per\s} and cold temperatures of a few tens of Kelvin. The underlying accretion disk has accretion rates higher, typically $\dot{M}_\mathrm{accr} = \SI{e-4}{M_\otimes\per\year}$.
\fxnote{Missing figure}

\subsubsection{Class II, Classical T-Tauri stars}
CTTS also have molecular flows around optical jets and knots. Besides the star is visible and we have much more information. The most powerful jet from a T-Tauri star is DG tau. It is also the best known. These premain stars have accretion-ejection systems with typical accretion rates of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{accr} = \SIrange{e-7}{e-6}{M_\otimes\per\year}$. Around $30\%$ of these objects also have jets with typical wind mass loss rates of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{jet} = \SIrange{e-8}{e-7}{M_\otimes\per\year}$, densities $n_\mathrm{jet} = \SIrange{e3}{e7}{\cm\cubed}$ (this is strongly model dependant) and temperatures around $T_\mathrm{jet} = \SIrange{e3}{e4}{\K}$. Of course the density in the accretion disk is much higher and the temperature much lower.
\fxnote{Missing figure}

Some CTTS like RY Tau have some less luminous jets, but in those objects we can see on smaller scales micro jets.
\fxnote{Missing figure}

\paragraph{Accretion disks in T-Tauri}
\fxnote{Missing figure}
The HST has provided us with incomparable pictures of disks around T-Tauri. More information on accretion disks is expected from next generation of instruments like ALMA and Herschell (HIFI).

\subsubsection{Class III, Weak Line T-Tauri stars}
In the HR diagram, the pre-main sequence stars have tracks just above the main sequence. The global diagram is given here after.

\fxnote{Missing figure}

Next two figures illustrate how the Hayashi tracks calculated for the T-Tauri stars superimposed to CTTS and WTTS tend to indicate that WTTS are CTTS in a later stage. This was far from obvious originally.
\fxnote{Missing figure}

WTTS have no visible jets. This coincides with the fact that the disk and the star have lost their connection. Planets form during the class III phase as seen on this new image from ALMA.
\fxnote{Missing figure}

\subsection{Evolution and structure}

\subsubsection{Evolution}
The classification is a result of the evolution. In the first stages, accretion is massive and cold. The associated outflows are also very powerful but slow and cold. As the central star forms and evolves, the mass accretion rate decreases and the mass loss rate also, but the jet speed increases and the ejections is closer and closer to the central star. In the late stages of class II objects, the stellar jet becomes dominant over the disk driven jet.

The following scheme can be read from outside to inside.
\fxnote{missing scheme}
\subsubsection{Disk structure}

The inner morphology of the accretion system in YSOs is quite complex. This explains the variety of emissions.
\fxnote{Missing scheme}

The accretion disk is illuminated by the central star but also radiates by itself. The infra red excess seen above the black body emission from the star is the best signature of the presence of the disk.
\fxnote{missing figure}

As can be seen on the next figure, the interpretation of the disk spectrum involves various layers and components.
\fxnote{Missing figure}

\subsubsection{Multi-component jets}
\fxnote{Missing figure}
As in AGNs, multicomponent accretion disks and jets are needed. One major issue for the jet is to understand its origin, either purely stellar or disk or a mix of the two.
\fxnote{Missing figure and scheme}

Ferreira et al. (2006) plotted the rotation rate versus the poloidal jet velocity. It clearly shows that for the jet where the rotation is measured, disk winds are clearly favored. However, for the rotation to be detected, these jets have to be large and particularly luminous and correspond to early class II objects like DG Tau. X-Wind and stellar jets are still relevant for later phases.
\fxnote{Missing figure}
\subsection{Models and simulations}

\subsubsection{Disk winds}
Disk wind models basically assume that the main driving for accelerating the flow is the magnetocentrifugal dring of Blandford and Payne. The powerlaws of the self-similar solutions naturally explain the onion structure in density and velocity as shown on the next figures.
\fxnote{missing figures, as usual}
As the source is the extended disk, it ensures the possibility of producing a large jet radius. The collimation scale is roughly around $\sim \SI{50}{AU}$. The opening angle drops from \ang{30} to \ang{4}. The following figures shows the jet radius with distances as observed. \fxnote{Missing figures}.

Models are able to produce large mass loss rate and sufficient collimation, provided that a hot or warm corona exists on top of the disk, see figure … \fxnote{fix ref}. In analytical disk wind models, the accretion rate and the mass loss rate follow a power law:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{M} \propto r^\xi
\end{equation}
The ejection index is directly linked to the logarithmic mass loss. Typical values are:
\begin{align}
  \xi \sim 0.01 \quad \textrm{cold jet} \\
  \xi \sim 0.5 \quad \textrm{warm jet}
\end{align}
Various simulations of disk winds reproduce the same structure.
\fxnote{Missing figure}
\subsubsection{X-Wind}
X-winds as proposed by F. Shu and collaborators are a possible alternative to disk winds. As shown before the wind is expelled from a narrow region around the corotation radius where the stellar magnetosphere is connected to the accretion disk. Acceleration is agiain magnetocentrifugal.

In this configuration the wind do not really collimates but collimation is a consequence of the density profile and the emissivity.
\fxnote{Missing figure}
These model seem to be better explanations of the velocity profiles because of the very narrow range of initial velocities. However in the following figures \fxnote{put figure and ref} cold disk winds are considered and not warm ones, which are better at explaining the observed mass loss rates.

Beside the fact that the MHD equations are not completely solved in a consistent way, The major problem of this X-wind scenario is the stability and the lack of power. The fan \fxnote{ventilateur ?} configuration is shown to be highly unstable. An alternative could be that X-winds are the unstable components as shown in the numeric simulations of Romanova et al..
\fxnote{Missing figures}
\subsubsection{Stellar wind and magnetic braking}
Stellar winds got out of fashion because the thermal driving is not sufficient to explain the high mass loss rates and velocities observed. However, a complete description of the jet cannot exclude this inner part and moreover the stellar outflow is nowadays the only issue to the angular momentum problem.
\fxnote{Figure}
T-Tauri stars are rotation at 10\% of their breakup speed. Classical T-Tauri stars are rotating more slowly than weak T-Tauri stars. It was originally thought that the difference could come from the connection between the CTTS and its disk, which is absent for WTTS.

This is the so-called disk locking. A magnetic line of the star rooted in the disk beyond the co-rotation radius spins down the rotation of the star, while a line rooted below the co-rotation radius will spin it up. However simulations shown that the disk locking is inefficient because most of the lines are below the co-rotation radius in a stable configuration.

Magnetic braking (see \ref{fix ref} next section) from the magnetized stellar wind is more efficient. The following figures \fxnote{put them} illustrate a stellar jet solution collimating on large distances, adapted for low mass accretion rates as in RY Tau. The mass loss rate from the stellar wind is $\SI{e-9}{M_\odot\per\year}$. Collimation is magnetic but the outflow is pressure driven.

The density profile is compatible with observations in the jet of RY Tau. The temperature calculated as the ratio of the pressure to density is high. However, if the wind is pressure driven, it does mean that the total pressure is the kinetic component only. The pressure is the sum of various contributions (ram pressure, Alfvén waves, etc…). This the plotted temperature is an effective temperature larger than the real temperature.

\fxnote{Figures}

These analytical solution can be used as initial condition. The magnetosphere can be treated as a dead zone.

\fxnote{Figures}

The end result is to obtain sporadic X-wind but with steady accretion and stellar jet conversely to previously.

\paragraph{Braking time}

We can easily estimate the braking time of the central object (Schatzmann 1957, Weber \& Davis 1967, Mestel 1968). The angular momentum loss extracted by the wind is:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{J}_\star = \frac{2}{3}\varpi_A^2\Omega \dot{M}_\mathrm{wind}
\end{equation}
The total stellar angular momentum is
\begin{equation}
  J_\star = kr^2_\star \Omega M_\star
\end{equation}
$k$ depends on the stellar structure, \num{0.06} for the sun up to \num{0.2} for a fully convective star. This to remove the angular momentum of the star, it takes:
\begin{equation}
  \tau \approx \frac{J_\star}{\dot{J}_\star} \approx \frac{3kr^2_\star \Omega M_\star}{2\varpi_A^2\Omega\dot{M}_\mathrm{wind}} \approx \frac{3 kr_\star^2 M_\star}{2\varpi_A^2\dot{M}_\mathrm{wind}}
\end{equation}

\section{X-ray binaries and microquasars}
\subsection{X-ray binaries}
\subsubsection{Low Mass X-ray Binaries, Micro Quasars}
Binary systems in our galaxy are long thought to be sources of accretion and also outflows. Ironically, though accretion of gas from the companion onto a white dwarf, a neutron star or a solar mass black hole has long been suspected (since the early 50's) to explain the X ray emission, such accretion disk remain invisible and only very few jets have been measured in those objects. The X ray emission comes from a hot spot. It is usually variable because the companion eclipses the hot spot.

Again various classes of objects have been observed. One such class is the Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB). They can be represented with the following sketch (image).

For LMXB the eclipse rate is low, the disk is THICK and not thin. Thus the disk obscurs the central compact object which remains invisible. X-ray emission is seen through the diffusion by the photoionized corona (ex. Sagittarius X-7, V691 CrA).

GRS 1915+105 is a Low Mass X-ray Binary which is also a very well known micro-quasar. It is in fact the first galactic object where knots with relativistic motion (Mirabel, 1992) where measured. It appears as a down scaled version of a quasar. The spectrum undergoes various phases. Conversely to AGNs these can be interpreted in terms of evolution because we see a single object going through the various phases,

\begin{itemize}
\item A low X-ray emission with a Hard spectral index (low/hard X-rays). This is thought to correspond to a phase where the disk build up and the plasma ejection is low.
\item A high X-ray emission with a Soft spectral index (high/soft X-rays). In this phase the disk has disrupted and the central corona emits a strong wind that collimates into a jet.
\end{itemize}

In fact a continuous jet is known to exist even between two emission of blobs.

The analogy of microquasars with quasars can be seen in the comparison of the following two images: (figure).

\subsubsection{High Mass X-ray Binaries, Micro Quasar Pulsar}
Another class of X-ray Binaries are the HMXB or High Mass X-ray binaries. Cygnus X-3 is a good example with a central black hole:
\begin{itemize}
\item High Mass XB
\item Wolf-Rayet Companion
\item 4.8 hr Orbital Period
\item Strong Stellar Wind
\item 2 X-ray States: (a) low/hard, (b) high/soft
\item Relativistic Radio Jets
\end{itemize}

(figure)

This category is also relevant for pulsar like the Crab (figure).

The X-ray image of the Crab pulsar shows a jet but no accretion disk. In the equatorial plane appears an equatorial wind. The accretion disk may exist but in the inner central part of the object.

Another HMXB is Cygnus X-1 (Bosch-Ramon et al., 2005). Again we see that the spectrum is somewhat similar to the spectrum of an AGN but shifted in frequency: (figure).

The overall structure of the jet in optical and radio wavelengths is very similar to YSO jets... (figure)

... and always to low/hard and high/soft states seen below: (figure).

\subsubsection{Evolution of Micro-Quasars and X-Binaries}
Is microquasar evolution the clue to the various classifications?

Is the scenario Disk jet versus Crona like Seyferts versus Radio galaxies? Or like CTTS versus FUOR?

(figure)

This is probably not the last conclusion because the scaling is not so simple.

\subsection{Other galactic sources}
\subsubsection{Cataclysmic variables}
Cataclysmic variables are known systems with accretion disk and obscuration due to the companion: \textbf{HST Spectral Maps of Accretion Disks in Cataclysmic Binaries} (figure+legend)

\subsubsection{Gamma Ray Bursts, GRBs}
Among others, the fireball scenario of Gamma Ray Bursts -although it is the only interpretation of GRBs- invokes the presence of an accretion disk and a jet. However, in these objects, Lorentz factors larger than 100 are needed. This implies some very energetic process. (figure)

\subsubsection{Planetary Nebulae}
Last examples of beautiful outflows with or without (?) accretion disks are Planetary Nebulae. Here the outflow is not well collimated. Unless (see example on the left of fig. below) the nebula is just a cocoon and the jet is inside. (figure)

\subsection{GRAND CONCLUSION: Global Mechanism and evolution}

To conclude this lecture, we have seen that the accretion/ejection process occurs on very different scales. A common mechanism to explain the dynamics of these objects is required. However they differ profoundly in the radiation process and their spectra because of the variety of thermodynamical conditions and chemical compositions.

There are three main regions. The first is the source of ejection composed of the central object, its corona and the accretion disk. The accretion disk structure can be complex depending on the historical evolution, the central object and the outer boundary. The plasma that is ejected is accelerated and possibly collimated into a jet but not always. Then on larger distances, instabilities and shocks are likely to make the propagation of the jet quite complex.

\textbf{ANALOGY MICROQUASAR / QUASAR / GRB}

In the following sketch, the YSO jet is missing but could be added very simply with quite a few analogies: (figure)
